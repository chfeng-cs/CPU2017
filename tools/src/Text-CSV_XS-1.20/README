Module:
    Text::CSV_XS

Description:
    Text::CSV_XS provides facilities for the composition and decomposition
    of comma-separated values.  An instance of the Text::CSV_XS class can
    combine fields into a CSV string and parse a CSV string into fields.

Prerequisites:
    perl 5.6.1 or up.

    You can have working Test::More for 5.6.1 by requiring version
    Test::Harness-2.64 and Test::Simple-0.90

    I found no easy way to get Test::More working on 5.6.0

    examples/csv-check requires perl with defined-or and PerlIO, and
    making that work on other versions is left as an exercise to the
    reader. Other examples are checked against 5.8.4. For Unicode to
    work more or less reliable, you'd need perl 5.8.2 or newer.

Build/Installation:
    Standard build/installation:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make test
	make install

    Interface design by Alan Citterman <alan@mfgrtl.com>

    A pure-perl version is being maintained by Makamaka Hannyaharamitu
    as Text::CSV_PP, which tries to follow Text::CSV_XS. It is not worth
    filing bugs to Text::CSV_XS when Text::CSV is not in sync.

    Text::CSV_PP is bundled in Text::CSV, which now is a wrapper module
    over Text::CSV_XS and Text::CSV_PP that will select Text::CSV_XS if
    available, and otherwise use Text::PP.
