This directory contains tiny snippets of config files used by
    SPEC CPU2017 Config Files 
    http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/config.html

WARNING: None of these are even close to being usable in a
         publishable result.  They demonstrate simple 
         features from the above document.

To try an example, first copy it to your $SPEC/config or %SPEC%\config directory.  
Most are intended to be used in a dry-run, demonstration mode, with 

        --fake
or      --fakereportable

Unix Users
----------
   Many example.cfg files have a corresponding 
        example.sh  with the command that is used in the document.

   If you try the .sh files, it is LIKELY that you will need to adjust them.
   For reasons of documentation brevity, the scripts make Stupid Assumptions:

      +---------+ (1) No shebang.   They assume bash or equivalent.     
      | STUPID  |                   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)
      | SCRIPT  | (2) No cleanup.   They assume that output_root directories
      | ASS-    |                   are magically empty.
      | UMPTIONS| (3) Extreme cuts. They assume that only a tiny subset of the
      +---------+                   output is interesting.

   What you can do:
      - You could add a shebang and some cleanup.
      - Or, perhaps more usefully, change the script to send *all* its 
        output to a file, and then study the file in an editor.
              
Windows Users
-------------
   Microsoft Windows users, please forgive the fact that the .sh files make
   liberal use of Unix commands to subset the output, typically:

       grep       - pick lines by pattern
       head, tail - pick lines by position
       cut        - chop lines into pieces

   You could try to map the above to Windows commands (such as findstr), 
   but it would probably be easier to skip everything but the actual 
   'runcpu' commands.  

   You might try something like this:

        runcpu --fake --config=example > somefile

   and then bring up 'somefile' in an editor.
