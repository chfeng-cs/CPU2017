This directory is part of the documentation for SPEC CPU2017.  
It contains example config files.  

What is a config file?

   A SPEC CPU config file defines how to build, run, and report on
   SPEC CPU benchmarks in a particular environment.  

   The examples in this directory can help beginners get started, as
   described in the install guide (either Unix or Windows):

   https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/install-guide-unix.html#config
   https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/install-guide-windows.html#config

Steps

   - Begin by copying the Example config file to a new location.
   - Edit it, searching for the word EDIT.
   - As explained in the above install guides, pick one benchmark.
     - If it fails, see the suggestions in the above install guides.
     - If it works, try more benchmarks. 

Goals for these examples 

  - Provide a starting point for users new to the suite.
  - Include useful comments with links to documentation.
  - Use correct PORTABILITY flags.
  - Include a correct flagsfile.
  - Point out things that need to be changed with EDIT markers.
  - Where practical, try to provide a useful starting point even if
    chip, OS, or compiler versions are updated.  
  - Be rule-compliant
     - In particular, pick a single language dialect, as required by
       https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/runrules.html#BaseFlags
     - Prefer: dialect that matches rule
       https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/runrules.html#rule_2.3.1 (b) 
  - Non-goal: optimal performance

Not optimal?

   The examples in this directory are unlikely to provide the very best
   performance that can be obtained for any given system.  They are only
   a starting point.  

   If you are looking for more advanced examples, you might want to
   check out the config files that are available with published results.
