<h3>Benchmark Program General Category</h3>

<p>Combinatorial optimization / Single-depot vehicle scheduling</p>


<h3>Benchmark Description</h3>

<p>505.mcf_r is a benchmark which is derived from MCF, a program used for single-depot vehicle
scheduling in public mass transportation. The program is written in
C.  The benchmark version uses almost exclusively integer
arithmetic.</p>

<p>The program is designed for the solution of single-depot vehicle
scheduling (sub-)problems occurring in the planning process of
public transportation companies. It considers one single depot and
a homogeneous vehicle fleet. Based on a line plan and service
frequencies, so-called timetabled trips with fixed
departure/arrival locations and times are derived. Each of these
timetabled trips has to be serviced by exactly one vehicle. The
links between these trips are so-called dead-head trips. In
addition, there are pull-out and pull-in trips for leaving and
entering the depot.</p>

<p>Cost coefficients are given for all dead-head, pull-out, and
pull-in trips. It is the task to schedule all timetabled trips to
so-called blocks such that the number of necessary vehicles is as
small as possible and, subordinate, the operational costs among all
minimal fleet solutions are minimized.</p>

<p>For simplification in the benchmark test, we assume that each
pull-out and pull-in trip is defined implicitly with a duration of
15 minutes and a cost coefficient of 15.</p>

<p>For the considered single-depot case, the problem can be
formulated as a large-scale minimum-cost flow problem that we solve
with a network simplex algorithm accelerated with a column
generation. The core of the benchmark 505.mcf_r is the network
simplex code "MCF Version 1.2 -- A network simplex implementation",
For this benchmark, MCF is embedded in the column generation
process.</p>

<p>The network simplex algorithm is a specialized version of the
well known simplex algorithm for network flow problems. The linear
algebra of the general algorithm is replaced by simple network
operations such as finding cycles or modifying spanning trees that
can be performed very quickly. The main work of our network simplex
implementation is pointer and integer arithmetic.</p>

<p>Because there have been no significant errors or changes during
the years 2000 - 2004, most of the source code of the CPU2000
benchmark 181.mcf was not changed in the transition to CPU2017
benchmark 505.mcf_r. However, several central type definitions were
changed for the CPU2017 version by the author:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Whenever possible, long typed attributes of struct <tt>node</tt> and
struct <tt>arc</tt> are replaced by 32 bit integer, for example 
if used as boolean type. Pointers remain unaffected and map to 32
or 64 bit long, depending on the compilation model, to ensure
compatibility to 64 bit systems for truly large scale problem
instances.</p> </li>

<li><p>To reduce cache misses and accelerate program performance
somewhat, the elements of struct <tt>node</tt> and struct <tt>arc</tt>, respectively,
are rearranged according to the proposals made in "Memory Profiling
using Hardware Counters" by Marty Itzkowitz, Brian Wylie,
Christopher Aoki, and Nicolai Kosche (<a href=
"http://www.sc-conference.org/sc2003/paperpdfs/pap182.pdf">http://www.sc-conference.org/sc2003/paperpdfs/pap182.pdf</a>)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Input Description</h3>

<p>The input file contains line by line</p>

<ul>
<li>the number of timetabled and dead-head trips (first line),</li>

<li>for each timetabled trip its starting and ending time,</li>

<li>for each dead-head trip its starting and ending timetabled trip
and its cost.</li>
</ul>

<p>Worst case execution time is pseudo-polynomial in the number
timetabled and dead-head trips and in the amount of the maximal
cost coefficient. The expected execution time, however, is in the
order of a low-order polynomial.</p>

<h3>Output Description</h3>

<p>The benchmark writes to two output files, <tt>inp.out</tt> and <tt>mcf.out</tt>.</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>inp.out</tt> contains log information and a checksum</li>
<li><tt>mcf.out</tt> contains
check output values describing an optimal schedule computed by the
program.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Programming Language</h3>

<b>Regarding OpenMP:</b> Although the source code for the benchmark includes
OpenMP directives, these are intentionally suppressed for the SPECspeed2017&reg;
version of MCF, due to validation differences across different platforms that
were encountered during testing by SPEC&reg;.</p>

<h3 id="Portability">Portability issues</h3>

<p>The module <tt>spec_qsort.c</tt> does not obey strict ANSI aliasing rules.   You may need to add your compiler's flag that
informs it not to assume strict ANSI compliance. </p> 

<p>In particular, the problem has been observed with GCC as described in the section below.</p>

<h4>Known portability issue: Incorrect answers with GCC LTO+FDO</h4>

<p style="margin-bottom:.5em;">Some users of GCC 6 (and later) have reported that <tt>505.mcf_r</tt> gets wrong answers when
compiled with both link-time optimization (LTO) and feedback-directed optimization (FDO), for example at
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=83201">GCC bugzilla 83201</a>.  The problem can be seen when this is used
with GCC version 7.2.1:</p>
<pre style="margin-top:.5em;">default=peak:
   OPTIMIZE       = -g -O3 -flto 
   PASS1_OPTIMIZE = -fprofile-generate
   PASS2_OPTIMIZE = -fprofile-use</pre>

<p style="margin:.5em 0em;">the output from the 505.mcf_r section of <tt>runcpu</tt> includes:</p>

<pre style="margin-top:.5em;">*** Miscompare of inp.out; for details see
    /spec/cpu2017/benchspec/CPU/505.mcf_r/run/run_peak_test_apr21d-m64.0000/inp.out.mis</pre>

<p style="margin:.5em 0em;">and the referenced file begins:</p>

<pre style="margin-top:.5em;">$ head -6 inp.out.mis
0010:  simplex iterations         : 107102
       simplex iterations         : 107124
                                        ^
0014:  simplex iterations         : 152479
       simplex iterations         : 149776
                                     ^
$</pre>

<p><b>Analysis</b>  It was demonstrated that the problem can occur even when optimization is reduced to: </p>
<pre>default=peak:
   OPTIMIZE       = -g -O1 -flto -finline-small-functions -fstrict-aliasing 
   PASS1_OPTIMIZE = -fprofile-generate
   PASS2_OPTIMIZE = -fprofile-use</pre>
<p style="margin:.5em 0em;">as inlining decisions are made for modules <tt>pbeampp.c</tt> and <tt>spec_qsort.c</tt>.  
<br />On careful examination, it appears that the <tt>swap</tt> macros in <tt>spec_qsort.c</tt> violate strict ANSI aliasing
rules.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.1em;"><b>q1. Will SPEC fix <tt>spec_qsort.c</tt>?</b> </p>
<p style="margin:.1em 2em; text-indent:-2em;"><b>a1. No.  There are two reasons:</b></p>
<ul style="margin:.5em 0em;">
   <li><i>That's the way it is in real life</i>
      <br />The module <tt>spec_qsort.c</tt> is based directly on the BSD version, as updated
      Thu Mar 5 17:17:11 2015 UTC in revision 279666: <a
   href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/lib/libc/stdlib/qsort.c?revision=279666">https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/lib/libc/stdlib/qsort.c?revision=279666</a>.</li>
   <li><i>No moving targets</i>
      <br />SPEC CPU&reg;2017 has already been released.  Once source code has been released for a benchmark, SPEC
      strongly prefers not to change the source code unless there are compelling portability reasons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, therefore, that the patch attached to GCC bug 83201 <a
   href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=83201#c21">is not approved by SPEC</a> and would not be allowed in a
reportable run.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.1em;"><b>q2. Does SPEC care about language standards?</b> </p>
<p style="margin-top:.1em;margin-left:2em; text-indent:-2em;"><b>a2. Yes, SPEC cares about language standards.  </b>
<br />The time to demonstrate such caring is prior to release of a benchmark suite.   During benchmark
development, SPEC constantly pushes benchmarks away from proprietary methods and closer to standard methods.  
Pre-release testers are encouraged to help find such problems by using their compiler's <tt
   style="white-space:nowrap;">--standard=picky</tt> switches.  </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.1em;"><b>q3. So what should I do?</b></p>
<p style="margin:.1em 2em; text-indent:-2em;"><b>a3. If you are using GCC, add <tt>-fno-strict-aliasing</tt> to your flags</b>, for example:</p>

<pre style="margin:.2em 4em;">505.mcf_r=peak:
    EXTRA_COPTIMIZE = -fno-strict-aliasing</pre>

<p style="margin:.2em 2em;">Note that in base, where the <a
   href="https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/runrules.html#BaseFlags">rules</a> require consistent flags for all benchmarks,
you may already have that flag, because 500.perlbench_r needs it.  For example, your config file may have: </p>

<pre style="margin: .2em 4em;">intrate,intspeed=base: 
    EXTRA_COPTIMIZE = -fno-strict-aliasing -fgnu89-inline</pre> 
<p style="margin:.2em 2em;">(For information on the <tt>-fgnu89-inline</tt> flag, see the documentation for <a
   href="https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/benchmarks/502.gcc_r.html#portability" class="external">502.gcc_r</a>.)</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.1em;"><b>q4.  What about other compilers? </b></p>
<p style="margin:.1em 2em; text-indent:-2em;"><b>a4. Spelling varies.</b>
<br />You will need to look in your compiler documentation for the flag that tells the optimizer that it cannot assume strict
ANSI conformance. </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.1em;"><b>q5. Several other benchmarks use <tt>spec_qsort.c</tt>.  Are they affected?</b></p>
<p style="margin:.1em 2em; text-indent:-2em;"><b>a5. It's possible.  The same workaround would apply.</b>
<br />Specifically, <tt>spec_qsort.c</tt> is also used by 502.gcc_r, 602.gcc_s, 511.povray_r, 611.povray_s, 527.cam4_r, and
627.cam4_s.   
<br />It is conceivable that they might also need <tt style="white-space:nowrap;">-fno-strict-aliasing</tt>.</p>

<p>Background information about the vehicle scheduling problem can
be found in the author's Ph.D. thesis "Optimal Vehicle scheduling
in public transit", which is available via WWW at the author's
homepage <a href="http://www.zib.de/members/loebel">www.zib.de/members/loebel</a> or at
ftp://ftp.zib.de/pub/zib-publications/books/Loebel.disser.ps.</p>

<p>The work horse in the benchmark 505.mcf_r is the code "MCF Version
X.X -- A network simplex implementation", which is available for
academic use free of charge via WWW at www.zib.de. Information
about MCF is available in <a href=
"http://www.zib.de/opt-long_projects/Software/Mcf/">http://www.zib.de/opt-long_projects/Software/Mcf/</a></p>

<p>An excellent text book about the network simplex algorithm and
network flow in general is Ahuja, Magnanti, and Orlin: "Network
Flows: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications", Prentice-Hall, Inc.,
Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 1993.</p>

<p>MCF had originally been developed for application in the public
transportation systems of Hamburg and Berlin (BVG). For BVG, bus
scheduling was optimized in 1998 on the basis of MCF; BVG also owns
usage rights to the software that has been integrated into their
planning system BERTA.</p>

<p>The MCF method for vehicle scheduling later has been integrated,
into the vehicle and personnel planning system MICROBUS. This system
in now marketed by IVU Traffic Technologies AG (<a href=
"https://www.ivu.de">https://www.ivu.de</a>) to public transportation
companies; the bus service divions of the German and the Austrian
railway companies are among the licencees.</p>

<p>Compared with the original and the commercial versions, the
benchmark version has been simplified in the
I/O area, to keep the I/O content small. The main algorithmic part,
however, has been retained.</p>
