SPEC CPU&reg;2017 Benchmark Description</h1>
</div>
 
<h3>Benchmark Name</h3>
<p>508.namd_r</p>

<h3>Benchmark Author</h3>
<p>Jim Phillips &lt;jim &#x5b;at&#x5d; ks.uiuc.edu&gt;<br />

University of Illinois<br />

<h3>Benchmark Program General Category</h3>
<p>Scientific, Structural Biology, Classical Molecular Dynamics
Simulation</p>
 
<h3>Benchmark Description</h3>
<p>The 508.namd_r benchmark is derived from the data layout and inner
loop of NAMD, a parallel program for the simulation of large
biomolecular systems.</p>
<p>Although NAMD scales to over 200,000 cores for very large systems,
serial performance is equally important to the over 50,000 users who
have downloaded the program over the past decade.
Almost all of the runtime is spent calculating inter-atomic interactions
in a small set of functions.
This set was separated from the bulk of the code to form
a compact benchmark for CPU2017.</p>

<h3>Input Description</h3>
<p>The file <tt>apoa1.input</tt> is a 92224 atom simulation of apolipoprotein
A-I and is used as a standard NAMD benchmark. This particular file
format is created by NAMD 2.9 using the "dumpbench" command, and
eliminates the need for file readers and other setup code from the
benchmark. Test, train and ref read from the same input file, but run
the code for different number of iterations. For ref the code is run
for 49 iterations. For training 7 iterations should be used to properly
weight pairlist creation and usage.</p>

<h3>Output Description</h3>
<p>CPU2017 uses the "<tt>--output namd.out</tt>" command-line option
to produce an output file, <tt>namd.out</tt>,
containing various checksums on the force calculations. These should
be consistent across platforms, within roundoff error, and it is used for
validation. </p>


<h3>Known portability issues</h3>
<p>The benchmark is written in conservative C++, is quite portable,
and the inner loop code (module <tt>ComputeNonbondedStd.C</tt>) contains no
aliasing. The erfc() function is required for startup. On Windows,
<span style="white-space:nowrap; font-family:monospace;">-DSPEC_NEED_ERFC</span>
is defined during compilation to build a version
of erfc() for little-endian, 32-bit and 64-bit platforms. This is only
needed for startup, and should not affect overall performance.</p>

<p>NAMD was contributed directly to SPEC&reg; by the University of Illinois, and eventually became 508.namd_r.</p>
