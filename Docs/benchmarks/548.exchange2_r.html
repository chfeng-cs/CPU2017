<h3>Benchmark Name</h3>

<h3>Benchmark Author</h3>
<p>Michael Metcalf, Berlin</p>

<p>Michael Metcalf is the author of <a href="https://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100436361&amp;CFID=922239540">many</a> articles

<h3>Benchmark Program General Category</h3>
<p>Games: Sudoku Puzzle Generator</p>


<h3>Benchmark Description</h3>
<p>
   This program was written for development
   of non-trivial 9x9 sudoku puzzles. It has been used extensively 
   in informal competitions, which run for days. 
   Incidentally, it tests many Fortran 95 array handling features 
   (including some intrinsic functions) for use with integer arrays. 
   Unusually, it relies heavily on recursion (up to eight levels deep) but, 
   in contrast to most Fortran programs, uses no floating-point arithmetic. 
</p>


<h3>Input Description</h3>

<p>The input data file contains in each record a valid sudoku puzzle (one
   that has one and only one solution). It is represented as a string of 81 
   digits, 1 to 9 for the clues, and 0 for the empty cells. Each puzzle 
   acts as a seed for the production of further valid puzzles with an 
   identical pattern of clues. 

   For convenience, the submitted program contains a data set of 27 puzzles
   in the form of an initialization expression. A second set can be extracted 
   from the first by not transposing the puzzle on input.</p>


<h3>Output Description</h3>
<p>
   The file s.txt contains each new puzzle as an 81-digit string 
   followed by a sequence number and 1 or 2 codes.

<p>Fortran 95</p>


<h3>Known portability issues</h3>
