NAME

   rxp - XML parser program

SYNOPSIS

   rxp [  -abemnNRsStvVx ] [ -o b|p|0|1|2|3|i|d ] [ U 0|1|2 ] [ -c encoding ]
   [ url ]

DESCRIPTION

   rxp reads and parses XML from the url (or standard input if none is
   provided) and writes it to standard output, optionally expanding entities,
   defaulting attributes, and translating to a different output encoding.

   rxp accepts XML 1.0 and 1.1, and the corresponding versions of XML
   namespaces. It implements the Oasis XML catalog specification.

   Common option combinations are -Nxs to check a document for
   well-formedness and namespace well-formedness, and -VNxs to also check for
   DTD-validity.

OPTIONS

        -a       Insert declared default values for omitted attributes.
        -v       Be verbose.
                 Validate the document. Repeating this option will make the
        -V       program treat validity errors as well-formedness errors, and
                 exit after the first validity error (otherwise a warning
                 will be printed for each one).
                 Read the whole DTD (internal and external parts) regardless
        -d       of any standalone declaration. Otherwise a declaration
                 "standalone='yes'" will prevent the external part from being
                 read (unless validation is selected).
                 Enable XML namespace support. The document will be checked
        -N       for correct namespace syntax, and if -b is specified
                 qualified element and attribute names will be displayed with
                 their URIs.
                 The value of this flag is a time limit in seconds, after
        -R       which the program will abort. This is to protect against
                 denial-of-service attacks using malicious documents.
        -S       Keep track of xml:space attributes. This will only affect
                 output when -b is specified.
        -e       Obsolete, do not use.
        -E       Do not expand entity references (opposite of old -e flag)
        -s       Be silent (that is, suppress output). Useful for
                 benchmarking or if you just want to see the error messages.
        -b       Print output as "bits".
        -n       Treat the input as normalised SGML rather than XML. Not
                 intended for general use.
                 If this flag is p, output is in the default (plain) format.
                 If it is b, output is printed as "bits" (equivalent to -b).
                 If it is 0, output is suppressed (equivalent to -s). If it
        -o       is 1, 2 or 3, output is in first, second or third canonical
                 form. If it is i, output is a dump of the document's
                 infoset. If it is d, output is in a form suitable for use
                 with "diff"; in particular attributes are sorted into
                 alphabetical order.
        -m       Merge PCData across entity references. This will only affect
                 the output when -b is specified.
        -t       Read in the input as a tree, rather than bits. Should make
                 no difference to the output.
    -u base_uri  Use the specified base URI when resolving system
                 identifiers.
                 This flag controls Unicode normalization checking and is
                 only relevant when parsing XML 1.1 documents. If it is 0, no
                 checking is done. If it is 1, rxp checks that the document
        -U       is fully normalized as defined by the W3C character model.
                 If it is 2, the document is checked and any unknown
                 characters (which may be ones corresponding to a newer
                 version of Unicode than rxp knows about) will also cause an
                 error.
                 Strict XML mode. This suppresses some warnings (eg entity
                 redefinitions) but treats all XML well-formedness errors as
        -x       fatal. This flag implies the -a flag, and sets the output
                 encoding to UTF-8 unless the -c flag is given. It sets the
                 output format to first canonical form unless the -o, -b or
                 -s flag is given.
                 Produce output in the specified character encoding. Known
                 encodings include ISO-8859-1, UTF-8, ISO-10646-UCS and
    -c encoding  UTF-16. 16-bit encoding names my be suffixed with -B or -L
                 to specify big- or little-endian byte order (the default is
                 the host byte order). If no -c or -x option is given, output
                 is in the same encoding as the input document.
                 Force use of the document type specified by sysid. The root
   -D name sysid element name for validation is name. Any DTD in the document
                 is ignored. This flag does not imply validation; use -V if
                 required.
        -i       Do xml:id processing. Attributes named xml:id are recognised
                 as IDs even if not declared.
        -I       The same as -i, but in addition xml:id attributes are
                 checked for uniqueness.
                 Use a shorter format for error messages. Particularly useful
        -z       when using the parser in Emacs compilation mode, so that
                 Emacs can find the error location.

EXIT STATUS

   If the -V flag is given, and the document is well-formed but not valid, 2
   is returned. If the document is not well-formed, or a system error occurs,
   1 is returned. Otherwise 0 is returned. Since the parser can expand
   external entities even when not validating, it treats certain errors which
   are technically validity errors as well-formedness errors. If -x is not
   specified, some well-formedness errors produce only warnings and do not
   affect the exit status.

ENVIRONMENT

   If the environment variable XML_CATALOG_FILES is set, XML catalog
   processing is enabled. The variable should be set to a space-separated
   list of catalog files. The variable XML_CATALOG_PREFER may be set to
   public or system to set the initial mode for catalog processing; the
   default is system.

   If the variable RXPURL is set, it is used as the URL of the document to
   parse. This may be useful in CGI scripts and the like to avoid shell
   parsing of a user-supplied argument.

   The variable http_proxy can be used to specify a proxy for HTTP
   connections. The syntax is hostname[:port].
