Introduction to the SPEC CPU(R)2017 License Agreement

   SPEC CPU(R)2017 is a product of the SPEC(R) non-profit corporation (about
   SPEC). The SPEC CPU 2017 source code and tools are provided under a SPEC
   License Agreement(pdf format; plain text is also available) The license
   contains the terms and conditions of your agreement with SPEC. Read it
   carefully before using the product. A copy is also on your distribution
   media, in the Docs/licenses/ directory.

   The following points are not a substitute for that License Agreement, but
   may be helpful as an introduction:

     * If your corporation buys SPEC CPU 2017, you may share it within your
       corporation.
     * Don't send it elsewhere.
     * Don't post it to the public.
     * Use it only for benchmarking.
     * Public use is governed by:

          * The SPEC-wide Fair Use Rule www.spec.org/fairuse.html and
          * The SPEC CPU 2017 rules www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/runrules.html

     * Freely-redistributable source components included within SPEC CPU 2017
       are licensed separately, and remain freely redistributable.

Freely-redistributable sources

   SPEC gratefully acknowledges the many free and open source software
   contributions that are used in SPEC CPU 2017.

     * The directory redistributable_sources/original contains archives of
       original sources that were used.
     * The directory redistributable_sources/modified contains archives of
       sources as modified by SPEC.
     * The directory Docs/licenses contains copies of the license documents
       for both SPEC and for redistributable sources.
     * The file Docs/licenses.html (which you are reading now) identifies
       which licenses apply to which source components, as used by benchmarks
       and by the SPEC CPU 2017 tool set.

  Note 1: Licenses and bug reporting

   In the table below, several benchmarks are marked as using the GNU GPL.
   For each, SPEC's updated sources are available in the ISO image for your
   copy of SPEC CPU 2017, in a compressed tar file underneath
   redistributable_sources/modified.

   One possible use for modified sources is for bug reporting. If you wish to
   provide an entire benchmark to a compiler developer, generally you are not
   allowed to do so, unless the developer also has a license for SPEC CPU
   2017. The exception is for the GPL benchmarks: for those, you may, if you
   wish to do so, pass along the tarball from
   redistributable_sources/modified. In that situation, please note that:

     * The benchmark inputs are generally not redistributable, unless marked
       otherwise.
     * SPEC's validator and SPEC's expected answers are not redistributable.
     * SPEC's benchmark setup and reporting harness are not redistributable.
     * Included within each tarball in redistributable_sources/modified is
       script simple-build<name>.sh, which creates a binary using
       gcc/g++/gfortran on Linux/x86. Of course, to report a bug with some
       other compiler, you will need to modify the example.

  Note 2: about "BSD" licenses

   SPEC tried to track down all software license references within all files
   in SPEC CPU 2017. Many modules were found with BSD (or similar) licenses.
   Copyrights for such modules must be acknowledged in the documentation if
   they are shipped in binary form. Separate acknowledgment is not required
   if they ship as source code (which is how SPEC CPU 2017 ships).

   Nevertheless, having identified these modules, it seems only courteous to
   acknowledge them -- even if not legally required. Most are acknowledged in
   this document, with the exception of BSD contributions to 526.blender,
   which are in an Appendix, because there are so many.

   When considering BSD licenses, one should be careful not to confuse
   "acknowledgment" with "advertising". To the best of SPEC's knowledge, no
   BSD-licensed materials in SPEC CPU 2017 require advertisement. (Only one
   source file in SPEC CPU 2017 mentions such a clause, and that file is
   copyright by Berkeley, who have explicitly disclaimed the requirement.)

Benchmarks

   The table lists redistributable sources used by benchmarks, and the
   license or licenses that apply to them.

   Adobe Core 14 Notes

   The text version of the Adobe Font Metrics license has been modified to
   include only the visible content from the original

 MustRead.html

   The modifications, although invisible, are nevertheless prominently noted,
   as is required.
   A pointer is also included to the unmodified original.
   (One cannot help but wonder if the inclusion of invisible ink was a little
   test?)
