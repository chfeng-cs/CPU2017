Introduction

   This document describes known problems in SPEC CPU(R)2017, a product of
   the SPEC(R) non-profit corporation (about SPEC).

   Do you have a problem with SPEC CPU 2017?
   Try these, in this order:

    1. Update your copy with runcpu --update.
    2. Check the latest version of Frequently Asked Questions.
    3. Check the latest version of Known Problems.
    4. Check the src.alt list.    [What is a src.alt?]
    5. Contact SPEC.

   SPEC CPU 2017 was tested on a variety of systems prior to release,
   including Unix, Linux, and Windows systems. Nevertheless, as with any
   software product, problems may be found too late in the testing process to
   be fixed in the release, or may be discovered after release.

   If you discover problems that are not listed here or in the FAQ, please
   report them to SPEC.

   About the format of this document:

     * Problems may be added in the Open section from time to time. In each
       case, a workaround is given, if one is known.
     * When problems are fixed, they are moved to the Closed section.

   Notice to maintainers: When updating this document, please do not ever
   re-use problem numbers.

Open Problem Reports

   Please see the latest on-line version of this document for information on
   open problems and suggested workarounds.

  3. Headings may appear to be off-center in ASCII plain text reports.

     * Problem summary: For text reports, when comparing report titles vs.
       data tables, the headings appear to be too far to the right. (#960)
     * Details: The headings are actually centered relative to the widest
       line in the report. Therefore, if the report has many lines that are
       80 columns wide, but one line that is 250 columns wide, then the
       headings will be printed near to column 125.
     * Status: As of SPEC CPU 2017 v1.1, this problem is less severe, because
       the common cause for very wide lines has been fixed. Nevertheless, it
       is possible that you might notice that headings appear further right
       than desired for plain text reports.

  5. Why can't I override fields from sysinfo?

     * Problem summary: Unwanted lines are sometimes included for fields that
       are supplied by both sysinfo and by the config file. (#591)
     * Details: The documentation says that when fields (such as hw_memory)
       are supplied by sysinfo, a config file can supply a different value by
       using a higher-priority section, for example:

 intrate,fprate,intspeed,fpspeed:
    hw_memory001 = 256 GB (8 x 32 GB 2Rx4 PC4-2133P-R,
    hw_memory002 = running at 1600)

     * Limitation: If you want your higher-priority section to "win", then
       you need to make sure you supply exactly the same field names,
       including any line numbers:

 If sysinfo supplies    and you supply     Then the report will have
 -------------------    --------------     -------------------------
 hw_memory001           hw_memory001       2 lines for memory description
 hw_memory002           hw_memory001

 hw_memory001           hw_memory100       4 lines for memory description
 hw_memory002           hw_memory200

 sw_os                  sw_os100           3 lines for the operating system
                        sw_os110

     * Workaround: Check what sysinfo will supply, and match it. If that is
       not possible, then you will need to edit the fields prior to using
       rawformat to prepare final reports.

  8. When measuring power, runcpu may hang.

     * Problem summary: Certain power measurements may hang. (#963)

     * Details: The problem occurs only if all the following conditions are
       present:

         1. You have selected runcpu --power or the corresponding config file
            option.
         2. You are running benchmarks drawn from multiple suites.
         3. One of the suites uses preenv and another does not.

     * Workaround: Split your runcpu command into one for each suite.

 Instead of:
    runcpu --config=myconfig intrate fprate
 Try:
    runcpu --config=myconfig intrate
    runcpu --config=myconfig fprate


Closed Problem Reports

  1. Some lines may be tiny in PDF reports.

     * Problem summary: Sometimes a line may be printed that is too small to
       read. (#585,#598,#764,#536)
     * Details: Commonly, the problem happened when SPEC CPU 2017 v1.0
       automatically generated notes about environment variables.
     * Resolution: As of SPEC CPU 2017 v1.1, environment variable reports are
       automatically wrapped.
     * Can fonts still be tiny? Maybe, but it is much less likely.

          * The SPEC CPU toolset no longer generates extra-wide environment
            variable notes.
          * If you choose to create your own extra-wide notes, then you might
            still see a tiny font.
          * To avoid that problem, please avoid extra-wide notes, and please
            keep an eye out for messages such as:

     format: PDF ->
     A line in your General Notes section is too long!

  2. Some lines may be too wide in HTML reports.

     * Problem summary: Sometimes a line may be printed that is much wider
       than your screen.
     * Resolution: The cause of this problem, and the resolution, are the
       same as for the previous problem.

  4. Plain text columns should have better alignment. (#630)

     * Problem summary: These columns do not line up as well as they should:

                 Base     Base       Base
 Benchmarks     Copies  Run Time     Rate

 525.x264_r         44        817       94.3  S

     * Resolution: This problem was fixed in SPEC CPU 2017 v1.0.5.

  6. The runcpu --comment option must not contain any blanks.

     * Problem summary: In v1.0.0, you could not use blanks within a runcpu
       --comment (#693, #783)
     * Details: In SPEC CPU 2017 v1.0.0, if you use the --comment feature
       with any blanks in the comment -- such as

 runcpu --comment="Some descriptive text"

       then you will see warning messages:

 Can't find benchmark 'descriptive'
 Can't find benchmark 'text'

     * Resolution: This issue was fixed in SPEC CPU 2017 update v1.0.5.

  7. Can't use an undefined value as an ARRAY reference while formatting
  results. (#708, #763)

     * Problem: After you edit a rawfile, you are unable to create reports
       with SPEC CPU 2017 v1.0.0 rawformat. Instead of its normal termination
       message:

 rawformat finished at 2017-06-16 06:58:10; 38 total seconds elapsed

       the program just stops, after printing messages similar to:

 Parsing flags for 554.roms_r base: done
 Doing flag reduction: done
     format: flags -> CPU2017.001.fprate.flags.html
 Can't use an undefined value as an ARRAY reference at /cpu2017/bin/formats/html.pl line 1390.

     * Cause: This error may occur if you delete raw file fields instead of
       editing them.
     * Resolution: SPEC CPU 2017 v1.0.5 and later are less sensitive to
       missing fields.
