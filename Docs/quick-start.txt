   This document provides a quick start for SPEC CPU(R)2017, a product of the
   SPEC(R) non-profit corporation (about SPEC).

   Do you want to start here?

     * If you are new to SPEC CPU, benchmarking, compilers, response time vs.
       throughput, SPECspeed vs. SPECrate, please see: Overview.
     * Just want to dive in?     This document is for you.
     * Just want an example? Scroll to bottom.

   All users should read the rules before using results in public.

   Decide which benchmark(s) to start with:   SPEC CPU 2017 includes 43
   benchmarks arranged in 4 suites. You can run one or more individual
   benchmarks, such as 500.perlbench_r, or you can run entire suites, using
   one of the Short Tags below.

   The "Short Tag" is the canonical abbreviation for use with runcpu, where
   context is defined by the tools. In a published document, context may not
   be clear.
   To avoid ambiguity in published documents, the Suite Name or the Metrics
   should be spelled as shown above.

   Verify requirements:   (Brief summary; see detail in System Requirements)
     - 1 to 2 GB of main memory to run SPECrate (per copy); 16 GB for
   SPECspeed.
     - 250 GB disk space is recommended; a minimal installation needs 10 GB.
     - C, C++, and Fortran compilers (or a set of pre-compiled binaries from
   another CPU 2017 user).
   A variety of chips and operating systems are supported.

   Install it:   Mount (Unix, Windows) the ISO image, then use install.sh or
   install.bat. Install guides: Unix, Windows

   Find a Config File:                    To use runcpu, you need a config
   file - a file that defines how to build, run, and report on the SPEC CPU
   benchmarks in a particular environment, including any needed PORTABILITY
   flags for your compilers.

    1. There are examples on your installed copy of SPEC CPU 2017. Look for
       an Example that matches your compiler, operating system, and hardware,
       in directory:

 $SPEC/config/Example*        (Unix) or
 %SPEC%\config\Example*       (Windows)

    2. Or, look for results for a system similar to yours at
       www.spec.org/cpu2017/results. Click the 'config' link.
    3. Or, if you are using binaries supplied by another user of CPU 2017,
       that person should also supply the config file.
    4. Or, write your own.

   Name it:   Copy your selection to a new file in the config directory. Do
   not use blanks in the name. Hint: make the name something useful to *you*.

 %SPEC%\config\Rahuls_first_test.cfg
 $SPEC/config/JeffWantsYetAnotherTest.Compiler.v11.beta4.cfg

   Edit the label:    Look for a line like one of these:

 %define label something

   or

 label = something

   The label is an arbitrary tag added to your binaries and directories,
   which comes in handy when you need to hunt them down. As with the config
   file name, make it something meaningful to *you*. No blanks are allowed.

   Other Edits:

    1. Look for any locations marked EDIT and make changes as needed.
    2. Look for paths and adjust if needed (example: your compiler is in
       /opt/bin but the config file uses /usr/bin).
    3. Look for any commands in the config file, and verify that they will
       not cause surprises.

       Warning: SPEC CPU config files can execute arbitrary shell commands.
       Read a config file before using it.
       Don't be root. Don't run as Administrator. Turn privileges off.

   Open a terminal window (Unix) or cmd window (Microsoft Windows) if you
   have not already done so.

   Set paths: Use a path command from the table below. On Unix systems,
   determine whether you are using a C-compatible-shell (such as csh, tcsh)
   or a Bourne-compatible shell (such as sh, bash, ksh, zsh).

System    shell      Example                    Instructions
                     C:\> f:                    Edit the file shrc.bat before using it, as
Microsoft cmd.exe    F:\> cd diego\cpu2017      explained in the Windows Install Guide. If you
Windows              F:\diego\cpu2017\> shrc    have done so, cd to your top directory and use:
                                                shrc.bat
          C-shell    % cd /home/subhash/cpu2017 cd to the directory where you installed SPEC CPU
          compatible % source cshrc             2017 and say:
                                                source cshrc
                                                cd to the directory where you installed SPEC CPU
Unix                                            2017 and try:
          Bourne     $ cd /home/subhash/cpu2017 source shrc
          compatible $ source shrc              If your shell is sufficiently old that it
                                                responds source: not found then try:

                                                 . ./shrc     <--that's dot-space-dot-slash-shrc

   Check disk space: Verify your free disk space (Recommendations). On Unix,
   use df and on Windows notice the last line on any dir command.

   Ready to run: You're ready to give it a try. Enter runcpu --config=name
   followed by a list of benchmarks or suites (see table above). Examples:

 runcpu --config=eniac.cfg    --action=build 519.lbm_r
 runcpu --config=colossus.cfg --threads=16   628.pop2_s
 runcpu --config=z3.cfg       --copies=64    fprate

   The first example compiles the benchmark named 519.lbm_r. The second runs
   the SPECspeed benchmark 628.pop2_s using 16 OpenMP threads. The third runs
   64 copies of all the SPECrate 2017 Floating Point benchmarks. The Install
   Guide chapter on "Testing Your Installation" has suggestions that start
   small and build up (Unix, Windows).

   Example Install: This example presumes that your name is Walter, your
   compiler is GCC, your operating system is Linux, and your hardware is x86.

 $ sudo mount -t iso9660 -o ro,exec,loop cpu2017.iso /mnt
 $ cd /mnt
 $ ./install.sh                                       # Specify destination - for example, /home/walter/cpu2017
 $ cd /home/walter/cpu2017/
 $ source shrc
 $ cd config
 $ cp Example-gcc-linux-x86.cfg walter-try1.cfg       # Pick one matching *your* system!
 $ vi walter-try1.cfg                                 # Customize paths and other items marked EDIT in the example
 $ runcpu --config=walter-try1 SPECspeed2017_int_base
