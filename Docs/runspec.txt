Redirect, with explanation. (Short version)

   For SPEC CPU(R)2017, the runspec utility has been renamed runcpu

   SPEC(R) has many benchmarks, covering many areas; the term runcpu
   specifically designates the area being measured.

   The documentation is in the SPEC CPU 2017 User Guide, runcpu.html.

Redirect (Longer, with story of benchmark origins)

                    Performance Wizards ran Dhrystone and Whetstone;
                    Measured Waarden Integration, and RIGGS calibration;
                    Ran Livermore Loops, and Prime Number Sieves;
   Once upon a time Plus Jacobi, Gauss, and Tower of Hanoi.
                    Some systems were rated with VUPs and
                    Some with megaflops guaranteed-not-to-exceed.

                    What source code did you use, did you modify it, did the
   Meaning unclear  benchmark get the correct answers, can customers
                    reproduce what you did, has anyone reviewed your methods,
                    and can I compare your results to others?

   In 1989, SPEC was formed to fix the above, with:

   check Comparable scores. check Derived from real applications.
   check Known source code. check Documented conditions of observation.
   check Portable code.     check No "benchmark specials".
   check Answer checking.   check Written run rules.
   check Reproducibility.   check Publication venue requiring peer review.

   It is not difficult to remember this history because it keeps being
   repeated.
   When you encounter a newly-invented benchmark, try the above checklist on
   it.

   Time went by. SPEC made many new benchmarks.

   The first SPECmark tested:  CPU, memory hierarchy, compiler
                               file servers, web servers, Java, graphics,
   Other SPEC benchmarks test: virtualized systems, distributed systems,
                               power, and more.

   For over 20 years, it has been wildly ambiguous to speak of running
   "SPEC".

   No such benchmark SPECyear

   For over 20 years, to avoid ambiguity, it has been necessary to add the
   benchmarking area.
   Certainly, it is not enough to just add a year.
   SPEC never released:       spec2000        spec2006        spec2017
   These are:                 SPEC CPU 2000   SPEC CPU 2006   SPEC CPU 2017

   Summary: If the command must be short and easy to type, 'runcpu' is a less
   ambiguous shortening.
