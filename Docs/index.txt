    Updates

   SPEC CPU 2017 may be updated from time to time. To update your copy, use
   runcpu --update.

   History:

     * v1.1.0, Sep-2019: fully support power measurement. See SPEC CPU 2017
       Changes in v1.1.
     * v1.0.5, May-2018: improve Spectre/Meltdown vulnerability reporting;
       improve GCC compatibility for both examples and documentation.
     * The list of Revisions has more detail.

    Tools

                                Getting Started
   Quick Start            A one-pager to get you started quickly.
                          Overview of the suite and the process, including
   Overview/What's New    Why this benchmark? What are the metrics? How does
                          CPU 2017 differ from previous suites?
   System Requirements    Hardware and software needed to use SPEC CPU 2017.
                          Installation guides. The "Unix" guide applies to
   Installing on Unix     AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris and similar
   Installing on Windows  systems. The Windows guide is for Microsoft Windows
                          systems.
                                   Basic Use
                          The runcpu command is the primary user interface
   Using SPEC CPU 2017    for running SPEC CPU 2017 benchmarks and reporting
   (runcpu)               results. Everyone using the suite will need this
                          document.
                          The rules must be studied carefully prior to
   SPEC CPU 2017          submitting results to SPEC for publication, and
   Run and Reporting      prior to quoting results in public. Caution: the
   Rules                  rules may be updated. Published result must comply
                          with the current version
                          at www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/runrules.html.
                            Customizing Your Testing
                          SPEC CPU 2017 provides benchmarks in source code
                          form. A "config file" specifies how to compile them
   Config Files           and controls many aspects of how they are run. If
                          you are a new user, you will probably start with an
                          existing config file, such as one downloaded from
                          www.spec.org/cpu2017.
                          When the benchmarks are compiled, compilation flags
                          (such as -O2 or -unroll) are detected and
                          automatically reported. Flag description files help
                          the tools recognize flags and report on them. Your
                          compiler vendor may supply a flag description file
   Flag Description Files for you, which you can reference via the config
                          file flagsurl field.
                          In addition to compiler flags files, there are also
                          "platform" flags files, where you describe items
                          such as Operating System tuning and BIOS settings.
                          It is likely that you will need to write your own
                          Platform Flags File.

   Monitoring Facility    Information about monitoring hooks.
                          How to use specinvoke, specdiff, specmake and other
   Utilities              utilities. Also, manpages are available for FILEPP
                          (specpp) and RXP (specrxp).
                          Although runcpu automates many benchmarking tasks,
                          sometimes you may prefer to work "by hand", perhaps
   Avoiding runcpu        because you want to modify a benchmark, collect
                          traces for a simulator, or debug an experimental
                          compiler. This document describes how to minimize
                          use of SPEC's toolset.
