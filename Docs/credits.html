      <h2>Background: a Worthy Predecessor</h2>
      <div class="l1">

         <p>One of the most frequent questions SPEC&reg; has been asked over the past decade has been "When is the next SPEC
         CPU&reg; suite coming out?" This has not been easy to answer, in part because the SPEC CPU 2006 benchmark suite has
         been widely used.</p>

         <p>SPEC CPU 2006 improved over its predecessors, and was intended to stand the test of time, as the computing industry
         continues to innovate.  It has had a long and influential run.</p>

         <p>A lot of work went into SPEC CPU 2006, and it paid off: as of June 2017, there are over 44,000 SPEC CPU 2006
         results published at 
         <a href="https://www.spec.org/cpu2006/results/" class="external">www.spec.org/cpu2006/results</a>, for an average of
         ~338 submissions a month, ~78 a week or ~11 every day.  And this doesn't include information on the runs that were
         not submitted to SPEC. Quite impressive for a benchmark that can take a bit of time and effort to set up and run.
         </p>

         <p>Although there is a large established base set of results, the time has come to update things. </p>

      </div>

      <h2>Goals and Challenges for the New Suite</h2>
      <div class="l1">

         <p>As with the previous SPEC CPU suites, the goal is to establish a suite of source code benchmarks to provide 
         consistent, comparable measures of CPU-intensive performance.  The task is not simple.</p>

         <p class="snugbot">Challenges include:</p>
         <ul class="snug">
            <li>Locating meaningful programs.</li>
            <li>Porting them to numerous environments.</li>
            <li>Defining rules to govern how benchmarks are compiled, run and reported.</li>
            <li>Developing tools to help enforce these rules while still making things easy to use. </li>
            <li>Defining processes by which decisions can be made. </li>
         </ul>

         <p>With SPEC CPU 2017, the SPEC CPU subcommittee believes that it has come up with a benchmark suite that builds upon
         and improves the previous suite, to meet the current and next generations of computing.</p>

         <p class="snugbot">The new suite: </p>

         <ul class="snug">
            <li> Increases the number of applications and application areas.</li>
            <li> Uses more complex application source code.</li>
            <li> Uses more memory for the SPECspeed metrics.</li>
            <li> Allows parallelization for SPECspeed programs by using OpenMP directives.  </li>
            <li> Improves the tools for building, running, and reporting.</li>
            <li> Adds an optional power metric. </li>
            <li> Clarifies and updates the run rules.</li>
            <li> Improves the documentation.</li>
         </ul>

         <p>The SPEC CPU subcommittee hopes that the updates will continue to to be useful for people designing and comparing
         computing systems. </p>

         <p>As with previous suites, there have been numerous people whose contributions have affected the end results,
         especially given the long development time. </p>

      </div>

      <h2>Thank you to Program Authors and Contributors</h2>
      <div class="l1">

         <p>SPEC CPU benchmarks are based primarily on real-world applications (rather than using loop kernels or artificial
         stress tests).  We therefore -- most of all -- thank the authors of those real-world applications.</p>

         <p>Thank you to contributors via the SPEC CPU Benchmark Search Program, contributors who work for member companies,
         and to the many authors of open source software.  They are listed in 
         <a class="external" href="licenses.html#benchmarks">SPEC CPU 2017 Licenses</a> and in the documentation for
         individual <a class="external" href="index.html#benchmarks">benchmarks</a>.</p>

         <p>These are the people who spent time finding and porting code, performed testing and analysis, participating in
         the debate and discourse on the processes, rules and content of the suite. Much appreciation is given for their
         willingness to spend their talents and time working on SPEC CPU 2017 efforts and day to day SPEC work. Contributions
         included project leading benchmarks, providing regular resting reports, writing documentation or overseeing some
         aspect of the process.  A little bit of each of these people can be found in the suite: </p>
