<h2 id="intro">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>SPEC CPU&reg;2017 (a
product of the SPEC&reg; non-profit corporation <a href="https://www.spec.org/spec/" class="external">(about SPEC)</a>)  
is a source code benchmark. 

Using SPEC CPU 2017 requires access to a computer system running a supported
operating system with the necessary compilers and tools to generate executable binaries for the system.  The benchmarks
require the use of compiler commands as well as other commands via a shell or command prompt window  (aka "terminal window",
"console", "CMD window", "terminal emulator", etc.)</p>

<p>SPEC can provide limited technical support for:</p>

<ul>
   <li> Installing CPU 2017 on a UNIX/Linux, Windows or Mac OS X system.</li>
   <li> Using the CPU 2017 tools to run the benchmarks.</li>
   <li> Building the CPU 2017 tools.</li>
   <li> Updates for known issues.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="before">2. Before contacting SPEC</h2>

<h2 id="contact">3. Contact Information</h2>

<p>SPEC CPU 2017 technical support can be reached by sending email to:</p>

<p style="margin-left:3em;">cpu2017support at spec&#46;o&#114;g</p>

<p>Additional/updated contact information can also be found at SPEC's primary Web Site: <a class="external"
href="https://www.spec.org/">www.spec.org</a></p> 


<h2 id="limits">4. Limitations on support</h2>

<p>SPEC can provide only limited advice regarding:</p>
<ul>

   <li><p><b>Miscompares.</b>  If your system gets an answer that the tools consider to be incorrect, the usual advice is try
      asking your optimizer to be less aggressive.  If you do report a miscompare, and if we recognize it, we can tell you so.
      But if the miscompare requires digging through the entrails, you'll probably have to use a debugger, and you may have
      to report a bug to your compiler vendor. </p></li>

   <li><p><b>New platforms.</b>  The list of supported platforms is in the document <a class="external"
         href="system-requirements.html#SupportedTools">SPEC CPU 2017 System Requirements</a>.  If you install on a platform
      that does not have tools, see <a class="external" href="tools-build.html">Building the SPEC CPU 2017 Toolset</a>. If you
      report problems with the build, we might or might not be able to help you.  Often, the problem needs to be taken apart
      on the system where the build is being attempted.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In general, SPEC can provide technical assistance with its benchmarks, but SPEC does not have the ability to provide
support on other vendor's products. Examples of support that SPEC can not provide include:</p>

<ul>
   <li> Hardware installation issues.</li>
   <li> Hardware problems.</li>
   <li> Non-SPEC software installation issues.</li>
   <li> Non-SPEC software problems.</li>
   <li> Hardware specific tuning.</li>
</ul>

<p>If known, SPEC will provide a pointer to the appropriate source of information.  Otherwise for these and similar issues,
it is suggested that the hardware or software vendor be contacted directly.</p>


<h2 id="include">5. Useful information to include when contacting SPEC</h2>

<div class="l1" style="padding:3px 5px;border:thin solid red;width:400px;">
   <p class="snug"><span class="alarm">When writing to SPEC to request help with a problem, please attach your config file and the relevant
      log files, preferably as a compressed tarball.  </span></p>
</div>
<div class="l2">
   <table>
   <tr>
      <td colspan="2">For example, if you are using <samp>myconfig.cfg</samp> 
         and the failure was seen during the 17th run, 
         <br />then you could create a file called <samp>problem.tar.xz</samp> 
         using commands similar to these.  </td>

         <br />In the Windows example, the same operations are done as 2 separate commands. 
         <br />In both cases, the file <samp>problem.tar.xz</samp> is created, which you can attach to your email.)</td>
   </tr>
   </table>
</div>


<p>In addition to your config file and log file, the following information should also be provided when requesting 
help with an issue:</p>

<ol> 
   <li id="ex1"> The revision of the benchmark suite that you're using - please say "<samp class="nbsnuglr">runcpu
         -V</samp>"</li>

   <li id="ex2"> The specific nature of the problem and the symptoms.  Please give the exact error message.  If the message says
      "<samp class="nbsnuglr">see file x/y/z.err</samp>", then please include the contents of <samp class="snugr">x/y/z.err</samp>.</li>

   <li id="ex3"> Type of hardware/name of system being used.</li>
   <li id="ex4"> Name and version of the operating system.</li>
   <li id="ex5"> Name and version of the compiler.</li>
   <li id="ex6"> If a compilation issue:

         <li> check if problems exist at lowest level of optimization.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li id="ex7"> Has this issue been tried or seen on other systems?</li>
</ol>

<p>Additional details related to the problem are also appreciated.</p>

<h2 id="source">6. Benchmark source code change requests</h2>

<p>Although the SPEC CPU 2017 benchmarks are very portable, new systems or language standard changes may require source code
modifications.  Under the run rules, no publication of results may be done using modified source code, unless SPEC has
approved the change.  This section describes how to go about making a request to SPEC for a source change.</p>

<p>By including all the relevant information, you will make it easier for SPEC to consider your request.  Nevertheless, please
note that SPEC may or may not grant your requested change.  SPEC will consider a request for a source change in a similar manner to
how it considers <a class="external" href="runrules.html#portability">portability flags</a>, weighing aspects such as performance
neutrality, amount of code affected, and impact on the original intent of the program. </p> 

<p> Proposals for changes to benchmark source code should include the information mentioned in the previous section, plus:</p>

<ol> 

   <li id="ex8" value="8"><p class="snugbot">A "context diff", typically via <samp class="nb">diff -u</samp> (or, if that
      is unavailable, <samp class="nbsnugr">diff -C</samp>).  Specify the original file FIRST.</p>
      <pre class="snug">  diff -u  somefile.original.cxx  somefile.proposed.cxx </pre>
      <p class="snug">  If the changes are extensive,
      or if your <samp>diff</samp> utility does not know how to provide concext-sensitive diffs, then attach the files.   You
      can package them up and compress them by saying something like this:</p>
      <pre class="snugtop">  spectar cvf - newsrc/* | specxz &gt; proposed.tar.xz</pre>
   </li>

   <li id="ex9">A clear statement of what happens without the proposed change.</li>

   <li id="ex10">A clear statement of whether a workaround exists.  Are there any conditions under which the benchmark can be
      made to work <b>without</b> the proposed change?   </li>

   <li id="ex11">If possible, a specific reference to the relevant portion of the compiler language standard.   </li>

   <li id="ex12">If possible, results of testing for both correctness and performance when the same change is applied on
      some hw/sw platform <b>other</b> than the one where the problem was observed.</li>

   <li id="ex13">If the problem has been reported to the compiler vendor, a reference to a specific bug number, case number,
      mail archive message number, web forum address, or compiler developer email address.</li>

   <li id="ex14">If the problem has not been reported to the compiler vendor, a brief statement as to why not.</li>

   <li id="ex15">If the problem needs to be solved by a certain date, please say so, and why.</li>

</ol>
