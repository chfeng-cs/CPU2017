                  SPEC CPU(R)2017 NOT-A-Benchmark Description

  NOT-A-Benchmark Name

   999.specrand

  What do you mean NOT-A-Benchmark?

   999.specrand is not timed; it's purpose is primarily as a short, but
   important, diagnostic.

   Although it is not timed, in all other respects, it behaves like an
   ordinary benchmark.
   Therefore the remainder of this description will stop tediously inserting
   "NOT-A".

  Benchmark Description

   999.specrand is a small harness for the [1]Mersenne Twister algorithm.

   The benchmark simply generates a sequence of pseudorandom numbers starting
   with a known seed. This benchmark is not a timed component of CPU2017;
   rather, it's there as an indicator of larger problems. Several of the
   other benchmarks use the specrand code as their PRNG. Thus, a failure in
   999.specrand would point out a source of error in those codes as well.
   This is cheap (in both time and space) insurance.

  Input Description

   999.specrand's input consists of two numbers: a seed value for the PRNG,
   and a count of the numbers to generate.

  Output Description

   The specified number of random numbers are generated and output four
   times.

   The first set is unscaled output from spec_rand() output as a standard
   floating point number with no precision modifiers (printf '%f' format).
   The second set is output from spec_rand() scaled to between 1 and 2^31-1
   (0x7fffffff, or the maximum positive value that a signed 32-bit integer
   can hold), and is output as a the original number, the multiplier, and the
   result as a standard integer (printf '%d' format).

   The third set is the output from spec_lrand48() scaled to between 0 and 1
   and output in printf '%f' format. The fourth sequence is unscaled output
   from spec_lrand48() in printf '%d' format.

   The PRNG is re-seeded between sequences.

  Programming Language
