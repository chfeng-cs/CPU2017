<h3>Benchmark Program General Category</h3>
<p>Discrete Event Simulation</p>

<h3>Benchmark Description</h3>

<p>The benchmark performs discrete event simulation of a large 10
gigabit Ethernet network. The simulation is based on the OMNeT++
discrete event   simulation system ([1]www.omnetpp.org), a generic
and open simulation framework. OMNeT++'s primary application area is
the simulation of communication networks, but its generic and
flexible architecture allows for its use in other areas such as the
simulation of IT systems, queueing networks, hardware architectures
or business processes as well.
</p>

<p>The ten gigabit Ethernet network model used in this benchmark is
publicly available as part of the INET Framework from the address
given in the References.</p>

<p>For the reference workload, the simulated 10 Gbps network models a
large network comprised of six backbone switches, eight small LANs,
twenty medium LANs and twelve large LANs.</p>


<h3>Input Description</h3>
<p>The structure of hosts is described in NED files (NED is the network
   description language of OMNeT++.) Operation of the physical layer models,
   MAC, traffic generator, etc. are in C++.</p>

<p>Several model parameters are specified in the omnetpp.ini file.</p>

<p>Parameters modified for the different workloads are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>sim-time-limit:</em> sets the simulation time limit</li>
<li><em>sim.host[*].appl.nbPackets</em>: declares the number of packets to be
sent by each node</li>
</ul>

<h3>Output Description</h3>
<p>The model computes summary statistics during the simulation
execution to minimize disk space usage and facilitate the results
analysis. The node that receives the traffic generated by all network
nodes computes for each source node several latency parameters (among
which: mean, median, minimum and maximum). In addition, the same
latency parameters are also computed for all received packets. At the
routing layer, the number of packets sent, received and forwarded, as
well as route statistics are also generated. This is typically used
to track down route establishment difficulties. At the MAC layer,
each node keeps track of the number of frames sent and received,
along with backoff statistics. This type of information is useful to
identify network congestion.
