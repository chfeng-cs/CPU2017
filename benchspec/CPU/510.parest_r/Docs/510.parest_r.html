<h3>Benchmark Name</h3>

<h3>Benchmark Program General Category</h3>
<p>A finite element solver for a biomedical imaging problem</p>

<h3>Benchmark Description</h3>

<p>510.parest_r solves a problem from biomedical imaging. Specifically, the
underlying problem is the reconstruction of interior properties of a 3d body
from multiple observations at its two-dimensional surface, in much the same way
as multiple 2d X-ray images are combined to do 3d CT (computed tomography)
scans. The difference to CT scans is that the method this program describes is
infrared light that does not go through tissues in a straight line, but
diffuses.  </p>

<p>In order to understand how the overall algorithm works, let us stick with the
example of CT for a moment. CT involves taking X-ray exposures of a body from
different angles, and obtaining developed photo plates (or today, the data that
comes from the digital X-ray detectors) placed on the other side of the body
from the X-ray cannon. There is then a mathematical algorithm called the "<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon_transform">inverse Radon
transform</a>" that reconstructs the 3d interior make up of the body from these
2d exposures.  </p>

<p>When given a number of exposures from different angles, an implementation of
the algorithm will create some reconstruction of the body's interior. But is
your implementation correct? We don't know, because we don't know what the
<i>exact</i> make-up of the body was when the exposures were taken.  </p>

<p>What one therefore does to test such implementations is to <i>assume</i> an
exact make-up and <i>compute</i> what exposures this <i>would</i> produce if one
were to do actual experiments (these are called "synthetic" measurements). One
then uses the implementation of the method on these exposures to reconstruct the
body. Because we know the <i>exact</i> make-up of the body from which these
exposures were creates, we can compare the <i>exact</i> and the
<i>reconstructed</i> make-up and ensure that they are the same, or at least that
the reconstructed make-up converges to the exact one as we add more and more
exposures. </p>

<p>This particular benchmark, 510.parest_r, does not actually deal with CT
reconstructions. Rather, it is built to deal with a different biomedical imaging
method called "fluorescence-enhanced optical tomography" that uses infrared
light instead of X-rays because (i)&nbsp;infrared light is not harmful to
humans, and (ii)&nbsp;because it provides a better contrast between healthy and
diseased tissue than X-rays. The major difference between this method and CT is
that the relationship between the body's interior we would like to reconstruct
and what we can measure is not linear. Consequently, while a CT reconstruction
algorithm can compute the body's interior make-up in one step, optical
tomography methods need to do this iteratively: they start with an assumed
make-up and over a number of iterations improve it until they think that they
are close enough.  </p>

<p>Under the hood, this requires solving the predicting set of partial
differential equations many hundreds or thousands of times, for different
hypothetical make-ups. This is done on locally refined finite element meshes
that change over time as we hone in on the best reconstruction. In other words,
there is a loop over a number of iterations (corresponding to the output "Step
1", "Step 2", etc in the log file for this benchmark), each of which improves
our current best guess for the body's 3d interior make-up. Within each of these
iterations or "steps", the algorithm re-computes the synthetic measurements and
then loops over all of the experiments (corresponding to the exposures from
different angles in the CT example) and predicts what we would measure with the
current best guess make-up. At the end of each step, these predictions are then
compared against the (synthetic) measurements and an improved guess is
computed.</p>

<p> The implementation of all of this relies on the deal.II finite element
library (see <a href="https://www.dealii.org/"
class="external">www.dealii.org</a>) that also underlies the <a
href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/Docs/447.dealII.html">447.dealII</a> benchmark
that is part of SPEC CPU&reg;2006.  </p>


<h3 id="inputs">Input Description</h3>

<p>The input for 510.parest_r consists of a single input file with a suffix
<code>.prm</code> that describes the problem completely. There are
<code>test.prm</code>, <code>train.prm</code>, and <code>ref.prm</code> files in
the <code>data/</code> subdirectory of this benchmark.</p>

<p>The format of these input files is intended to be self explanatory, using a
set of parameters grouped into nested, hierarchical sections.  The parameters
are grounded in the mathematical and computational algorithms that underly the
problem, as well as the kinds of models that are implemented.</p>

<p>A few parameters are of particular interest for benchmarking: </p>

  <ul>
     <li><p><b>Number of experiments</b> (in section "Global options"): Just as
     a CAT scan (computed tomography) assembles a 3d image from a number of 2d
     X-ray images taken from different angles, the algorithm in this program
     reconstructs a 3d image of the body from multiple exposures, or
     "experiments".  This parameter controls how many experiments are used, each
     of which corresponds to projecting a different light pattern onto the
     surface of the body and measuring what light comes out.  Since all the
     experiments are used at the same time, this parameter affects both the run
     time of the program (using twice as many experiments will require
     approximately twice as much CPU time) and memory consumption (using twice
     as many experiments will require approximately twice as much memory). </p>
     </li>

    <li><p><b>Maximal number of iterations</b> (in section "Newton method"):
    Each "iteration" of the algorithm uses the previous best guess of the body's
    interior, and updates or improves upon it by solving a set of partial
    differential equations using the finite element method on a mesh or grid
    (that is, subdivision of the body into small quadrilaterals or hexahedrals).
    More iterations therefore require more CPU time.</p>

    <p>Note that the relationship is not linear: if the algorithm decides that
    on the current mesh, no further improvement is possible, it "refines" the
    mesh, that is, it replaces some cells by smaller cells. Consequently,
    allowing more iterations also (sometimes) leads to finer meshes which
    require more memory and more CPU time to solve. Each mesh refinement (as
    indicated in the "log" output file) approximately doubles the memory and CPU
    requirements of an iteration. </p></li>
    
    <li><p><b>Reduction per mesh</b> (in section "Newton method/Mesh refinement
    details"): If all that is desired is to vary the run time of the benchmark,
    then one can also adjust this parameter. The smaller it is, the more
    progress the algorithm needs to make on the current mesh before it refines
    the mesh. A value of zero implies that the mesh will never be refined; the
    run time is then proportional to the number of iterations, and memory
    consumption will remain roughly constant throughout the entire run.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p> The test, train, and refrate input files for this benchmark only
  differ in the values for the first two parameters above.  </p>

  <p>Additional information about the parameters may be found in the output file
  <code>me.prm</code> (see next section).</p>

<h3>Output Description</h3>

<h3>Programming Language</h3>
<p>C++</p>

<h3>Threading Model</h3>
<p>None</p>

<h3 id="portability">Known portability issues</h3>
<p>The benchmark should, in principle, only consist of standard C++98
  constructs. That was one of the design goals. </p>

<h4 style="margin-left:1.7em; margin-bottom:.5em;">Obtaining correct results with GCC and <tt>-m32</tt></h4>

<p style="margin:.5em 2em;">During testing with versions 5 and 6 of the GNU
compiler, there were a few reports of incorrect answers when compiling with 
<tt>-m32</tt>&nbsp;+&nbsp;high&nbsp;optimization.  Successful workarounds included:</p>

<ul style="margin:.5em 2em .5em 4em;">
<li> Use 64-bit compiles (<tt>-m64</tt>) instead of 32-bit (<tt>-m32</tt>). </li>
<li> Or, use <tt>-march=i686</tt> instead of more specific chip designators (such as <tt>-march=native</tt>).</li>
<li> Or, add <tt>-fno-tree-loop-vectorize</tt> to disable certain loop transformations which would otherwise 
be enabled at level <tt>-O3</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin:.5em 2em;">It should be noted that a workaround such as the
above would not qualify for use as a <a
href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/runrules.html#PortabilityFlags">portability</a>
flag. In a base compilation, it would need to be part of
the set of flags that are <a href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/runrules.html#BaseFlags">applied consistently</a> to a set of benchmarks.  
</p>

<h4 style="margin-left:1.7em; margin-bottom:.5em;">"error: ISO C++ forbids comparison between pointer and integer"</h4>

<p style="margin:.5em 2em;">Users of C++11 (and later) compilers may see messages such as the above.  For GCC V7, the 
full message is:</p>
<pre style="margin:.5em 3em;">In file included from include/base/parameter_handler.h:18:0,
                 from source/base/parameter_handler.cc:14:
source/base/parameter_handler.cc: In member function 'double dealii::ParameterHandler::get_double(const string&amp;) const':
source/base/parameter_handler.cc:752:28: error: ISO C++ forbids comparison between pointer and integer [-fpermissive]
   AssertThrow ((s.c_str()!='\0') || (*endptr == '\0'),
</pre>

<p style="margin:.5em 2em;"><b>Solution:</b> There are three solutions.  </p>
<ol class="l1">
   <li>Use <a class="external" href="runcpu.html#update">runcpu --update</a> to update your copy of SPEC CPU 2017 to v1.1; or</li>
   <li>Tell your compiler to be less picky (for example, with <samp class="snugr">g++ -fpermissive</samp>); or</li>
   <li>Try explicitly asking for the 2003 version of the standard (for example, with <samp class="snugr">g++ -std=c++03</samp>).</li>
</ol>

<p class="l1">Note: neither solution 2 nor solution 3 would qualify for use as a <a 
   class="external"
   href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/runrules.html#PortabilityFlags">portability</a> flag. In a base compilation, it
   would need to be part of the set of flags that are <a
      class="external"
      href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/runrules.html#BaseFlags">applied consistently</a> to a set of benchmarks.
