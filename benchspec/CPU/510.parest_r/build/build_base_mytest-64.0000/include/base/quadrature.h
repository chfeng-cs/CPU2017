/**
 * Base class for quadrature formulæ in arbitrary dimensions. This class
 * stores quadrature points and weights on the unit line [0,1], unit
 * square [0,1]x[0,1], etc.
 *
 * There are a number of derived classes, denoting concrete
 * integration formulæ. Their names names prefixed by
 * <tt>Q</tt>. Refer to the list of derived classes for more details.
 *
 * The schemes for higher dimensions are tensor products of the
 * one-dimansional formulæ. Therefore, a three-dimensional 5-point
 * Gauss formula has 125 quadrature points.
 *
 * <h3>Mathematical background</h3>
 *
 * For each quadrature formula we denote by <tt>m</tt>, the maximal
 * degree of polynomials integrated exactly. This number is given in
 * the documentation of each formula. The order of the integration
 * error is <tt>m+1</tt>, that is, the error is the size of the cell
 * two the <tt>m+1</tt> by the Bramble-Hilbert Lemma. The number
 * <tt>m</tt> is to be found in the documentation of each concrete
 * formula. For the optimal formulæ QGauss we have $m = 2N-1$, where
 * N is the constructor parameter to QGauss. The tensor product
 * formulæ are exact on tensor product polynomials of degree
 * <tt>m</tt> in each space direction, but they are still only of
 * <tt>m+1</tt>st order.
 *
 * <h3>Implementation details</h3>
 *
 * Most integration formulæ in more than one space dimension are
 * tensor products of quadrature formulæ in one space dimension, or
 * more generally the tensor product of a formula in <tt>(dim-1)</tt>
 * dimensions and one in one dimension. There is a special constructor
 * to generate a quadrature formula from two others.  For example, the
 * QGauss@<dim@> formulæ include <i>N<sup>dim</sup></i> quadrature
 * points in <tt>dim</tt> dimensions, where N is the constructor
 * parameter of QGauss.
 *
 * For some programs it is necessary to have a quadrature object for
 * faces.  These programs fail to link if compiled for only one space
 * dimension, since there quadrature rules for faces just don't make
 * no sense. In order to allow these programs to be linked anyway, for
 * class Quadrature@<0@> all functions are provided in the
 * <tt>quadrature.cc</tt> file, but they will throw exceptions if actually
 * called. The only function which is allowed to be called is the
 * constructor taking one integer, which in this case ignores its
 * parameter, and of course the destructor. Besides this, it is
 * necessary to provide a class Point@<0@> to make the compiler
 * happy. This class also does nothing.
 *
 * @note Instantiations for this template are provided for dimensions 1, 2,
 * and 3 (see the section on @ref Instantiations in the manual).
