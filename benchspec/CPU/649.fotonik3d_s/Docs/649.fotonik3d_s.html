      <h2>Benchmark Description</h2>
      <div class="l1">

         <p>Fotonik3D computes the transmission coefficient of a photonic
         waveguide using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method for
         the Maxwell equations. UPML for dielectric materials is used to
         terminate the computational domain.</p>

         <p>The core of the FDTD method is second-order accurate
         central-difference approximations of the Faraday's and Ampere's laws.
         These central-differences are employed on a staggered Cartesian grid
         resulting in an explicit finite-difference method. The FDTD method is
         also referred to as the Yee scheme. It is the standard time-domain
         method within CEM.</p>

         <p>The code consists of three steps, initialization, time-stepping and
         wrap-up. More than 99% of the time is spent in the time-stepping. Each
         time step is identical to all the others.  The majority of the time is
         spent in five routines: </p>
         <ol>
            <li> Updating the electric fields in dielectric materials </li>
            <li> Updating the magnetic fields in dielectric materials </li>
            <li> Computing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of electric and
            magnetic fields in power planes </li>
            <li> Updating the electric fields in UPML</li>
            <li> Updating the magnetic fields in UPML</li>
         </ol>

         <p>The FDTD-updates of the electric field during the time-stepping is
         done in the module material_mod while the FDTD-updates of the magnetic
         fields are done in the module update_mod.</p>

         <p>The excitation of the code is a 2D (x and z) cross section of the
         computational domain. A precomputed Single TE mode is read from file
         and multiplied with a time dependent pulse:</p>
<pre>
Ex(:,y_index,:) = Ex(:,y_index,:) + pulse(t)*Single_TE_mode(:,:)
</pre>
         <p>The computation of the excitation takes very little time.</p>

         <p>The module power_mod performs the computation of the power flow.</p>

         <p>During the initialization, two files containing a list of twinkles
         are read. A twinkles is one side of an FDTD-cell. These lists defines
         the two power planes through which we will compute the power flow. The
         input files also defines for which frequencies the power flow shall be
         computed.</p>

         <p>During the time-stepping a DFT is computed for the perpendicular
         components (x and z) of the interpolated electric and magnetic fields
         at the midpoint of each twinkle in the power plane.</p>

         <p>After time-stepping the power flow, i.e., Poynting's vector, is
         computed for each twinkle. Then the contribution from all the twinkles
         are summed for each frequency. This is written to an output file for
         both power planes. The transmission coefficient for each frequency can
         then be computed by a post-processing program. (In the real
         application we need to take more time steps in order to compute the
         power flow accurately.)</p>

      <h2>Input Description</h2>

      <div class="l1">
         <p>All input files are ASCII files.</p>

         <p class="snugbot"><b>yee.dat</b> is the main input file. Inputs in
         this file must come in a specific order.  For full details, see the
         source to 'init.F90'.  Among the fields are:</p>
         <ul class="snugtop">

            <li id="nxyz"><b>nx,ny,nz</b>: The size of the computational
            domain, nx by ny by nz cells</li>

            <li id="N_t"><b>N_t</b>: the number of time-steps.  Run time is 
            directly affected by the number of steps chosen.</li>

            <li id="OBC"><b>OBC</b>: Outer Boundary Condition.  Positive
            numbers request use of the Uniaxial PML method with that number of
            cells.  Higher numbers cause more memory usage.</li>
         </ul>

         <p class="snugbot"><b>power1.dat</b> and <b>power2.dat</b> define the
         two power planes were the power flow shall be computed:</p>

         <ul class="snug">
            <li>power1.dat is for the incident field</li> 
            <li>power2.dat is for the transmitted field. </li>
         </ul>

         <p class="snug">These files define the frequencies for which to
         compute the power flow. For details on these two files, see the source
         file 'power.F90'.  Among the fields are:</p>
         <ul class="snugtop">

            <li><b>Filename</b> points to the geometrical description of the
            power planes (for example, <b>trans_W3PC.def</b>, and
            <b>incident_W3PC.def</b>.)</li>

            <li id="Freq_no"><b>Freq_no</b> controls the number of frequencies
            to calculate, and directly affects the size all arrays allocated in
            routine 'power_init'.  It should be set to the same value in both
            power1.dat and power2.dat.</li>
         </ul>

         <p><b>OBJ.dat</b> describes the photonic waveguide. This file starts
         with a short list of values for relative permittivity (epsilon_r). It
         then assigns one of these epsilon_r-values to each electric component
         of every cell.</p>

         <p><b>PSI.dat</b> contains the definition of the single TE mode used
         for the Plane Source excitation. This file defines the location (its
         y-value) of the Plane Source and contains a pointer to a file,
         <b>TEwaveguide.m</b>, containing the description of the single TE
         mode.  This TE mode has been precomputed by another code. It contains
         (nx+1)*(nz+1) values.</p>

         <p>SPEC&reg; provides 4 workloads: test, train, refrate, and refspeed, with
         these characteristics:</p> 
         <ul>

            <li>The <a href="#Freq_no">Freq_no</a> increases across the 4
            workloads, from a low of 301 for test to a high of 4001 for
            refspeed.</li>

            <li>The first three use a problem size (<a href="#nxyz">nx, ny,
               nz</a>) of 120 x 470 x 120; the refspeed workload uses a size of
            240 x 940 x 240.  </li>

            <li>The <a href="#OBC">OBC</a> is 4 for test and train, 8 for
            refrate, and 12 for refspeed.</li>

            <li><div class="snug">The number of steps (<a href="#N_t">N_t</a>)
               is chosen to match SPEC's requirements:</div> 

            <ul class="snug" style="margin-left:.4em;">

               <li>Test steps are only a few, because test is intended simply
               to verify that a working executable has been built.</li>

               <li>Train steps are about 10% of the number of refrate
               steps.</li>

               <li>Refrate and refspeed steps are set to take the desired
               amount of time (on a particular system used during development
               of the benchmark suite).</li>

            </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Output Description</h2>
      <div class="l1">

         <p>The output ASCII-file, 'pscyee.out', contains the power values for
         each frequency for the two power planes. It also contains the values
         of Ec which can be used for normalization.   The values are validated
         by comparing them to a SPEC-provided set of expected outputs.</p>

         <p>Various progress information is written to standard output, which
         may be useful when debugging, especially if the benchmark is run
         directly from the command line.  When run under the control of the
         SPEC tools, standard out is captured to &lt;benchmark_name&gt;.log.
         This file is not validated.</p>
      </div>


      <h2>Programming Language</h2>

      <p class="l1">Fortran 95 + OpenMP</p>


      <h2>Known portability issues</h2>
      <div class="l1">

         <p>No portability issues known.</p>

         <p>It is perhaps worth mentioning that some calculations generate
         'subnormal' numbers (<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormal_number">wikipedia</a>)
         which may cause slower operation than normal numbers on some hardware
         platforms.  On such platforms, performance may be improved if "flush
         to zero on underflow" (FTZ) is enabled.  During SPEC's testing of
         Fotonik3d, the output validated correctly whether or not FTZ was
         enabled.</p>
