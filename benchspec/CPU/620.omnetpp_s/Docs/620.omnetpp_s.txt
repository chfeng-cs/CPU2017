   Discrete Event Simulation

  Benchmark Description

   The benchmark performs discrete event simulation of a large 10 gigabit
   Ethernet network. The simulation is based on the OMNeT++ discrete event
   simulation system ([1]www.omnetpp.org), a generic and open simulation
   framework. OMNeT++'s primary application area is the simulation of
   communication networks, but its generic and flexible architecture allows
   for its use in other areas such as the simulation of IT systems, queueing
   networks, hardware architectures or business processes as well.

   The ten gigabit Ethernet network model used in this benchmark is publicly
   available as part of the INET Framework from the address given in the
   References.

   For the reference workload, the simulated 10 Gbps network models a large
   network comprised of six backbone switches, eight small LANs, twenty
   medium LANs and twelve large LANs.

  Input Description

   The structure of hosts is described in NED files (NED is the network
   description language of OMNeT++.) Operation of the physical layer models,
   MAC, traffic generator, etc. are in C++.

   Several model parameters are specified in the omnetpp.ini file.

   Parameters modified for the different workloads are as follows:

     * sim-time-limit: sets the simulation time limit
     * sim.host[*].appl.nbPackets: declares the number of packets to be sent
       by each node

  Output Description

   The model computes summary statistics during the simulation execution to
   minimize disk space usage and facilitate the results analysis. The node
   that receives the traffic generated by all network nodes computes for each
   source node several latency parameters (among which: mean, median, minimum
   and maximum). In addition, the same latency parameters are also computed
   for all received packets. At the routing layer, the number of packets
   sent, received and forwarded, as well as route statistics are also
   generated. This is typically used to track down route establishment
   difficulties. At the MAC layer, each node keeps track of the number of
   frames sent and received, along with backoff statistics. This type of
   information is useful to identify network congestion.
