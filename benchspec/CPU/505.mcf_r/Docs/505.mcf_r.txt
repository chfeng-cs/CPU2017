  Benchmark Program General Category

   Combinatorial optimization / Single-depot vehicle scheduling

  Benchmark Description

   505.mcf_r is a benchmark which is derived from MCF, a program used for
   single-depot vehicle scheduling in public mass transportation. The program
   is written in C. The benchmark version uses almost exclusively integer
   arithmetic.

   The program is designed for the solution of single-depot vehicle
   scheduling (sub-)problems occurring in the planning process of public
   transportation companies. It considers one single depot and a homogeneous
   vehicle fleet. Based on a line plan and service frequencies, so-called
   timetabled trips with fixed departure/arrival locations and times are
   derived. Each of these timetabled trips has to be serviced by exactly one
   vehicle. The links between these trips are so-called dead-head trips. In
   addition, there are pull-out and pull-in trips for leaving and entering
   the depot.

   Cost coefficients are given for all dead-head, pull-out, and pull-in
   trips. It is the task to schedule all timetabled trips to so-called blocks
   such that the number of necessary vehicles is as small as possible and,
   subordinate, the operational costs among all minimal fleet solutions are
   minimized.

   For simplification in the benchmark test, we assume that each pull-out and
   pull-in trip is defined implicitly with a duration of 15 minutes and a
   cost coefficient of 15.

   For the considered single-depot case, the problem can be formulated as a
   large-scale minimum-cost flow problem that we solve with a network simplex
   algorithm accelerated with a column generation. The core of the benchmark
   505.mcf_r is the network simplex code "MCF Version 1.2 -- A network
   simplex implementation", For this benchmark, MCF is embedded in the column
   generation process.

   The network simplex algorithm is a specialized version of the well known
   simplex algorithm for network flow problems. The linear algebra of the
   general algorithm is replaced by simple network operations such as finding
   cycles or modifying spanning trees that can be performed very quickly. The
   main work of our network simplex implementation is pointer and integer
   arithmetic.

   Because there have been no significant errors or changes during the years
   2000 - 2004, most of the source code of the CPU2000 benchmark 181.mcf was
   not changed in the transition to CPU2017 benchmark 505.mcf_r. However,
   several central type definitions were changed for the CPU2017 version by
   the author:

     * Whenever possible, long typed attributes of struct node and struct arc
       are replaced by 32 bit integer, for example if used as boolean type.
       Pointers remain unaffected and map to 32 or 64 bit long, depending on
       the compilation model, to ensure compatibility to 64 bit systems for
       truly large scale problem instances.

     * To reduce cache misses and accelerate program performance somewhat,
       the elements of struct node and struct arc, respectively, are
       rearranged according to the proposals made in "Memory Profiling using
       Hardware Counters" by Marty Itzkowitz, Brian Wylie, Christopher Aoki,
       and Nicolai Kosche
       ([1]http://www.sc-conference.org/sc2003/paperpdfs/pap182.pdf)

  Input Description

   The input file contains line by line

     * the number of timetabled and dead-head trips (first line),
     * for each timetabled trip its starting and ending time,
     * for each dead-head trip its starting and ending timetabled trip and
       its cost.

   Worst case execution time is pseudo-polynomial in the number timetabled
   and dead-head trips and in the amount of the maximal cost coefficient. The
   expected execution time, however, is in the order of a low-order
   polynomial.

  Output Description

   The benchmark writes to two output files, inp.out and mcf.out.

     * inp.out contains log information and a checksum
     * mcf.out contains check output values describing an optimal schedule
       computed by the program.

  Programming Language

   ANSI C, mathematical library (libm) required.

   Regarding OpenMP: Although the source code for the benchmark includes
   OpenMP directives, these are intentionally suppressed for the
   SPECspeed2017(R) version of MCF, due to validation differences across
   different platforms that were encountered during testing by SPEC(R).

  Portability issues

   The module spec_qsort.c does not obey strict ANSI aliasing rules. You may
   need to add your compiler's flag that informs it not to assume strict ANSI
   compliance.

   In particular, the problem has been observed with GCC as described in the
   section below.

    Known portability issue: Incorrect answers with GCC LTO+FDO

   Some users of GCC 6 (and later) have reported that 505.mcf_r gets wrong
   answers when compiled with both link-time optimization (LTO) and
   feedback-directed optimization (FDO), for example at [2]GCC bugzilla
   83201. The problem can be seen when this is used with GCC version 7.2.1:

 default=peak:
    OPTIMIZE       = -g -O3 -flto
    PASS1_OPTIMIZE = -fprofile-generate
    PASS2_OPTIMIZE = -fprofile-use

   the output from the 505.mcf_r section of runcpu includes:

 *** Miscompare of inp.out; for details see
     /spec/cpu2017/benchspec/CPU/505.mcf_r/run/run_peak_test_apr21d-m64.0000/inp.out.mis

   and the referenced file begins:

 $ head -6 inp.out.mis
 0010:  simplex iterations         : 107102
        simplex iterations         : 107124
                                         ^
 0014:  simplex iterations         : 152479
        simplex iterations         : 149776
                                      ^
 $

   Analysis It was demonstrated that the problem can occur even when
   optimization is reduced to:

 default=peak:
    OPTIMIZE       = -g -O1 -flto -finline-small-functions -fstrict-aliasing
    PASS1_OPTIMIZE = -fprofile-generate
    PASS2_OPTIMIZE = -fprofile-use

   as inlining decisions are made for modules pbeampp.c and spec_qsort.c.
   On careful examination, it appears that the swap macros in spec_qsort.c
   violate strict ANSI aliasing rules.

   q1. Will SPEC fix spec_qsort.c?

   a1. No. There are two reasons:

     * That's the way it is in real life
       The module spec_qsort.c is based directly on the BSD version, as
       updated Thu Mar 5 17:17:11 2015 UTC in revision 279666:
       [3]https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/lib/libc/stdlib/qsort.c?revision=279666.
     * No moving targets
       SPEC CPU(R)2017 has already been released. Once source code has been
       released for a benchmark, SPEC strongly prefers not to change the
       source code unless there are compelling portability reasons.

   Note, therefore, that the patch attached to GCC bug 83201 [4]is not
   approved by SPEC and would not be allowed in a reportable run.

   q2. Does SPEC care about language standards?

   a2. Yes, SPEC cares about language standards.
   The time to demonstrate such caring is prior to release of a benchmark
   suite. During benchmark development, SPEC constantly pushes benchmarks
   away from proprietary methods and closer to standard methods. Pre-release
   testers are encouraged to help find such problems by using their
   compiler's --standard=picky switches.

   q3. So what should I do?

   a3. If you are using GCC, add -fno-strict-aliasing to your flags, for
   example:

 505.mcf_r=peak:
     EXTRA_COPTIMIZE = -fno-strict-aliasing

   Note that in base, where the [5]rules require consistent flags for all
   benchmarks, you may already have that flag, because 500.perlbench_r needs
   it. For example, your config file may have:

 intrate,intspeed=base:
     EXTRA_COPTIMIZE = -fno-strict-aliasing -fgnu89-inline

   (For information on the -fgnu89-inline flag, see the documentation for
   [6]502.gcc_r.)

   q4. What about other compilers?

   a4. Spelling varies.
   You will need to look in your compiler documentation for the flag that
   tells the optimizer that it cannot assume strict ANSI conformance.

   q5. Several other benchmarks use spec_qsort.c. Are they affected?

   a5. It's possible. The same workaround would apply.
   Specifically, spec_qsort.c is also used by 502.gcc_r, 602.gcc_s,
   511.povray_r, 611.povray_s, 527.cam4_r, and 627.cam4_s.
   It is conceivable that they might also need -fno-strict-aliasing.

   MCF had originally been developed for application in the public
   transportation systems of Hamburg and Berlin (BVG). For BVG, bus
   scheduling was optimized in 1998 on the basis of MCF; BVG also owns usage
   rights to the software that has been integrated into their planning system
   BERTA.

   The MCF method for vehicle scheduling later has been integrated, into the
   vehicle and personnel planning system MICROBUS. This system in now
   marketed by IVU Traffic Technologies AG ([10]https://www.ivu.de) to public
   transportation companies; the bus service divions of the German and the
   Austrian railway companies are among the licencees.

   Compared with the original and the commercial versions, the benchmark
   version has been simplified in the I/O area, to keep the I/O content
   small. The main algorithmic part, however, has been retained.
