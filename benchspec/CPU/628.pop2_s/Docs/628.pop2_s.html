SPEC CPU&reg;2017 Benchmark Description</h1>
</div>

<h3>Benchmark Name</h3>
<p>628.pop2_s</p>


<h3>Benchmark Author</h3>

<p>
Ocean Model Working Group and Los Alamos National Laboratory.<br />
CESM is sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Administration of the CESM is maintained by the Climate and Global Dynamics Division (CGD) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).
</p>


<h3>Benchmark Program General Category</h3>
<p>Climate modeling</p>

<h3>Benchmark Description</h3>
<p>The Parallel Ocean Program (POP) was developed at LANL under the sponsorship
of the Department of Energy's CHAMMP program, which brought massively
parallel computers to the realm of climate modeling. POP is a descendent
of the Bryan-Cox-Semtner class of ocean models first developed by Kirk Bryan
and Michael Cox [4] at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory
in Princeton, NJ in the late 1960s. POP had its origins in a version of the
model developed by Semtner and Chervin [18] [5].</p>

<p>628.pop2_s is a port to SPEC based on the CESM1.0 (Community Earth System Model) coupled climate model for simulating the
earth's climate system. Composed of four separate models simultaneously simulating the earth's atmosphere, ocean, land
surface and sea-ice, and one central coupler component, the CESM allows researchers to conduct fundamental research into the
earth's past, present and future climate states.</p>

<p>The ocean component of the CESM1.0 is the Parallel Ocean Program version 2 (<b>POP2</b>). This model is based on the POP
version 2.1 of the Los Alamos National Laboratory; however, it includes many physical and software developments incorporated
by the members of the Ocean Model Working Group
</p>

<p><b>MPI Stubs</b> This version of POP does not use MPI.  A set of 'mpi_serial' of routines were used to avoid removing the
MPI calls all over the place</p>

<h3>Input Description</h3>

<p>As 628.pop2_s contains the coupled system (CESM) there are a lot of input files, notably: <br />
drv_in.in, pop2_in, dlnd_in, dice_in and datm_in<br />
plus a lot of other text, binary and netcdf files.</p>

<p>The datasets are based on CESM data for COMPSET=C RES=4x5_gx3v7, but to reduce the size of 628.pop2_s datasets the files are truncated using ncdump/ncgen NETCDF utilities to represent 62 days of simulation.</p>
<p>The test, train and ref datasets are identical except for number of days to simulate: 1, 5 and 50.</p>
<p>The workload can be adjusted by changing number of days simulation in drv_in.in.  In addition, a second parameter in pop2_in: steps_per_day can be adjusted (for example, 12 vs 24 takes approximately twice as long). </p>
<p>Much more information about the inputs may be found in the <a href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.0/pop2/doc/users/POPusers_main.html">Parallel Ocean Program (POP) User Guide</a></p>

<h3>Output Description</h3>
<p>Similarly to the input files, as 628.pop2_s is part of a coupled system (CESM) there are a lot of text and binary output files.  The most important one is <br />
<b>ocn.log</b> which also is the file used in verification/validation of the run. </p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.0/pop2/doc/users/POPusers_main.html">Parallel Ocean Program (POP) User Guide</a></p>

<h3>Programming Language</h3>
<p>Fortran90 and C (for the NETCDF library which is an integral part of the ported code</p>


<h3>Known portability issues</h3>

<p>The progam uses NetCDF, which is packaged with the benchmark.</p>

<h4>Data Formats and Endian Issues</h4>

<p>Some input files are not read by NetCDF; instead, they are read as unformatted data from big-endian format files.
If you are using a little-endian platform, you will probably need to provide a compiler flag so that those files can be read properly.  For example:</p>
<ul>
   <li>GCC on little-endian systems <span class="ttnobr">-fconvert=big-endian</span>.</li>
   <li>Oracle Solaris Studio on a little-endian platform: <span class="ttnobr">-xfilebyteorder=big8</span></li>
   <li>Intel Fortan: <span class="ttnobr">-convert big_endian</span></li>
</ul>

<h4>NAMELIST Input Processing</h4>

<p style="margin-bottonm:.1em;">When reading NAMELIST input, your compiler needs to respect punctuation marks required by the Fortran 2003 standard (section 10.10.1.2 and note 10.35).  For example, consider the data file below. </p> 

<pre>
$ <b>cat -n datm_atm_in </b>
   1	 &amp;shr_strdata_nml
   2	   dataMode       = 'CORE2'
   3	   domainFile     = './domain.lnd.fv4x5_gx3v7.091218.nc'
   4	   streams        = 'nyf.giss.T62.stream.txt 1 1 1 ' ,
   5	                    'nyf.gxgxs.T62.stream.txt 1 1 1 ' ,
   6	                    'nyf.ncep.T62.stream.txt 1 1 1 ' 
   7	   vectors        = 'u:v'
   8	   mapmask        = 'nomask',
   9	                    'nomask',
  10	                    'nomask'
  11	   tintalgo       = 'linear',
  12	                    'linear',
  13	                    'linear'
  14	  /
$
</pre>

<p style="margin-top:.1em;">Your compiler must recognize that 3 elements are assigned for streams, 3 elements for mapmask, and so forth.</p>
