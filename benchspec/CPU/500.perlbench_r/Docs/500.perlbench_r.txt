                     SPEC CPU(R)2017 Benchmark Description

  Benchmark Name

   500.perlbench_r

  Benchmark Authors

   Larry Wall, et. al.

  Benchmark Program General Category

   Programming language

  Benchmark Description

   500.perlbench_r is a cut-down version of Perl v5.22.1, the popular
   scripting language. SPEC's version of Perl has had most of OS-specific
   features removed. To understand how SPEC's version differs from the
   original, please see the comments in spec_config.h.

  Input Description

   The reference workload for 500.perlbench_r consists of three scripts:

     * The primary component of the workload is the Open Source spam checking
       software SpamAssassin. SpamAssassin is used to score a couple of known
       corpora of both spam and ham (non-spam), as well as a sampling of mail
       generated from a set of random components. SpamAssassin has been
       heavily patched to avoid doing file I/O, and currently does not use
       the Bayesian filtering.
     * Another component is the popular freeware email-to-HTML converter
       MHonArc. Email messages are generated randomly and converted to HTML.
       In addition to MHonArc, which was lightly patched to avoid file I/O,
       this component also uses several standard modules from the CPAN
       (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network).
     * The third script (which also uses the mail generator for convenience)
       exercises a slightly-modified version of the 'specdiff' script, which
       is a part of the CPU2017 tool suite.

   The training workload is similar, but not identical, to the reference
   workload from CPU2000. The test workload consists of the non-system-
   specific parts of the actual Perl 5.20.1 test harness.

   Adding workloads is just a matter of adding another script and associated
   input data to the input directories. The script must have a .pl extension.
   If it needs input parameters, it will also be necessary to edit object.pm
   to enable those to be read from a file.

  Output Description

   In the case of the mail-based benchmarks, a line with salient
   characteristics (number of header lines, number of body lines, etc) is
   output for each message generated. During processing, MD5 hashes of the
   contents of output "files" (in memory) are computed and output. For
   SpamAssassin, the message's score and the rules that it triggered are also
   output.

  Programming Language

   ANSI C

  Known Portability Issues

   Windows compilers that do not automatically define _MSC_VER may define
   SPEC_CPU_NEED_POSIX_IDS as a portability flag to enable compilation.

   There are some known aliasing issues. The internal data structures that
   represent Perl's variables are accessed in such as a way as to violate
   ANSI aliasing rules. Compilation with optimizations that rely on strict
   compliance to ANSI C aliasing rules will most likely produce binaries that
   will not validate. A typical symptom that you might see is:

 Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0x7fa54a8031c0 at lib/strict.pm line 38.
 perlbench_r_base.may07a-m64(94624,0x7ffff25803c0) malloc: *** error for object 0x7fa54a4138a8: pointer being freed was not
 allocated
 *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
 Abort trap: 6

   Solution: Tell your compiler to be less aggressive in its optimizations,
   in particular as regards aliasing issues.
   For example, with GCC, you might try:
   -fno-strict-aliasing

  Sources and Licensing

   500.perlbench_r is based on perl-5.22.1, plus several third-party modules,
   including:

     * HTML-Parser
     * IO-stringy
     * MailTools
     * MHonArc
     * SpamAssassin
     * TimeDate

   Please see details in the document [1]SPEC CPU(R)2017 Licenses.

   To avoid any possible conflict with standard executables, the benchmark is
   given the name 'perlbench'. Its differences are primarily described in the
   comments to spec_config.h. In brief: perlbench is a constrained version of
   perl which tries to remove most operating-system-specific functions, while
   leaving behind a set of features which are interesting as a CPU benchmark.
   The SPEC CPU(R) suites intentionally do not spend significant time in
   operating system services or IO.
