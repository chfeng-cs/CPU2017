<h1>500.perlbench_r<br />
SPEC CPU&reg;2017 Benchmark Description</h1>
</div>

<h3>Benchmark Name</h3>
<p>500.perlbench_r</p>


<h3>Benchmark Authors</h3>

<p>Larry Wall, et. al.</p>


<h3>Benchmark Program General Category</h3>

<p>Programming language</p>


<h3>Benchmark Description</h3>

  <p>500.perlbench_r is a cut-down version of Perl v5.22.1, the popular scripting
  language.  SPEC's version of Perl has had most of OS-specific features
  removed.   To understand how SPEC's version differs from the original, please
  see the comments in <samp>spec_config.h.</samp></p>



<h3>Input Description</h3>

  <p>The reference workload for 500.perlbench_r consists of three scripts:</p>
  <ul>

   <li>The primary component of the workload is the Open Source spam checking
   software SpamAssassin.  SpamAssassin is used to score a couple of known
   corpora of both spam and ham (non-spam), as well as a sampling of mail
   generated from a set of random components.  SpamAssassin has been
   heavily patched to avoid doing file I/O, and currently does
   not use the Bayesian filtering.</li>

   <li>Another component is the popular freeware email-to-HTML converter
   MHonArc.  Email messages are generated randomly and converted to HTML.
   In addition to MHonArc, which was lightly patched to avoid file I/O,
   this component also uses several standard modules from the CPAN
   (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network).</li>

   <li>The third script (which also uses the mail generator for convenience)
   exercises a slightly-modified version of the 'specdiff' script, which
   is a part of the CPU2017 tool suite.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The training workload is similar, but not identical, to the reference
  workload from CPU2000.  The test workload consists of the non-system-
  specific parts of the actual Perl 5.20.1 test harness.</p>

  <p>Adding workloads is just a matter of adding another script and associated
     input data to the input directories.  The script must have a <tt>.pl</tt>
     extension.  If it needs input parameters, it will also be necessary to
     edit <tt>object.pm</tt> to enable those to be read from a file.</p>


<h3>Output Description</h3>

  <p>In the case of the mail-based benchmarks, a line with salient
  characteristics (number of header lines, number of body lines, etc) is
  output for each message generated.  During processing, MD5 hashes of the
  contents of output "files" (in memory) are computed and output.  For
  SpamAssassin, the message's score and the rules that it triggered are
  also output.</p>


<h3>Programming Language</h3>

<p>ANSI C</p>


<h3 id="portability">Known Portability Issues</h3>

  <p>Windows compilers that do not automatically define _MSC_VER may define
     SPEC_CPU_NEED_POSIX_IDS as a portability flag to enable compilation.</p>

  <p id="alias">There are some known aliasing issues.  The internal data
  structures that represent Perl's variables are accessed in such as a way
  as to violate ANSI aliasing rules.  Compilation with optimizations that
  rely on strict compliance to ANSI C aliasing rules will most likely
  produce binaries that will not validate.  A typical symptom that you might see is:</p>
  <pre class="l1snug">Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0x7fa54a8031c0 at lib/strict.pm line 38.
perlbench_r_base.may07a-m64(94624,0x7ffff25803c0) malloc: *** error for object 0x7fa54a4138a8: pointer being freed was not
allocated
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
Abort trap: 6</pre>
  <p class="hanging1snug"><b>Solution:</b> Tell your compiler to be less aggressive in its optimizations, in particular as regards
  aliasing issues.  
  <br />For example, with GCC, you might try:
  <br /><samp>-fno-strict-aliasing </samp></p>


<h3 id="license">Sources and Licensing</h3>

<p>500.perlbench_r is based on perl-5.22.1, plus several third-party modules, including:</p>
  <ul>
     <li>HTML-Parser </li>
     <li>IO-stringy </li>
     <li>MailTools </li>
     <li>MHonArc </li>
     <li>SpamAssassin </li>
     <li>TimeDate </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please see details in the document <a
    href="https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/licenses.html#bmk500.perlbench_r">SPEC CPU&reg;2017 Licenses</a>.</p>


<p>To avoid any possible conflict with standard executables, the benchmark is given the name 'perlbench'.  Its differences
are primarily described in the comments to <samp>spec_config.h</samp>.   In brief: perlbench is a constrained version of perl
which tries to remove most operating-system-specific functions, while leaving behind a set of features which are interesting
as a CPU benchmark.  The SPEC CPU&reg; suites intentionally do not spend significant time in operating system services or IO.</p>
