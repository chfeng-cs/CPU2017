                     SPEC CPU(R)2017 Benchmark Description

  Benchmark Name

   527.cam4_r

  Benchmark Author

   National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)

  Benchmark Program General Category

   Atmosphere General Circulation Model (AGCM)

  Benchmark Description

   The Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) is the atmosphere component used by
   the Community Earth System Model (CESM).

   This benchmark is running code which is part of the publicly released
   CESM-1.0.2. The version of CAM in that release is CAM-5.0. In order to
   obtain as robust a validation procedure as possible, the benchmark runs
   use a special configuration which employs a prescribed ocean only lower
   boundary condition. This is the configuration used by the Aqua-Planet
   Experiment Project.

   The model is run in a backwards compatibility mode to use the "cam4"
   physics package that was originally released in CAM-4.0, and which has
   been used in the majority of the CESM simulations done for CMIP5, as
   analyzed for the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).

   The validation procedure uses a perturbation growth test described
   [1]here.

  Input Description

   The files atm_in and drv_in contain the Namelist groups read by CAM and
   are documented [2]here.

   The data sets are identical for all four of the SPEC(R)-provided workloads
   (test, train, refrate, refspeed), with some differences in how they are
   processed:

     * Test and train do a smaller number of steps than the reference
       workloads.
     * At compile time, the speed version (627.cam4_s) includes the flag
       -DUSE_COSP. Therefore, the speed version processes each of the
       workloads using the COSP simulator. The rate version (527.cam4_r) does
       not use COSP.
     * The namelist variable [3]nhtfrq controls the write frequency for the
       history file. For test and train, the frequency is every timestep (1).
       For the reference workloads, the frequency is 30 timesteps.

  Output Description

   The log file, written to standard out, contains a summary of how the model
   has been configured. Some global statistics of the atmospheric state are
   printed for each model time step.

   The netCDF output file, h0.nc, contains global temperature fields for the
   written timesteps.

  Validation

   The program cam4_validate (which is built at the same time as the
   benchmark binary) compares h0.nc vs. SPEC's expected outputs using a root
   mean square differences. The validation program accepts 4 parameters:

   maxf:   Maxium of failures to print
   reltol: Allowable Relative tolerance
   ctrl:   Expected results (provided by SPEC)
   bench:  Results from a benchmark run

   The tolerance mentioned just above is set by routine compare_commands
   within {527.cam4_r,627.cam4_s}/Spec/object.pm.

   Lastly, specdiff checks the output of cam4_validate

   What this means when deciphering log files: If your run fails, you may see
   something like the following in the $SPEC/result log file:

 *** Miscompare of cam4_validate.txt; for details see
     /path/527.cam4_r/run/run_mumble.0000/cam4_validate.txt.mis
 0001:   PASS:  4  points.
         Failure at Step:  2 1 1 1
         ^

   The above message means that specdiff expected to find that cam4_validate
   had written PASS but instead cam4_validate has written other stuff. To
   find the details, you should cd to the run directory that was referenced
   in the log file, and examine cam4_validate.txt.

 $ head -4 cam4_validate.txt
  Failure at Step:  2 1 1 1
           Actual:  218.14015096246447
         Expected:  217.62126113318524
           Reltol:  2.384371024123735E-3
 $

   In the above example, the validation utility has printed the actual and
   expected values, and has indicated the validation tolerance that would be
   needed if this difference were acceptable.

  Programming Language

   Fortran90 and C

  Version and Licensing

   The CAM-5.0 code has been extracted from CESM-1.0.2 and is public domain
   software.

  Known portability issues

   Depends on NETCDF as packaged with the benchmark. By default, the workload
   will be formatted to use big endian. To use little endian formatting, set
   the appropriate compiler option to byte-swap the input I/O or set the
   define flag SPEC_WORDS_LITTLEENDIAN.

   The OpenMP version of CAM4 uses a large amount of stack space. The exact
   amount will vary by system, compiler, and number of threads. You will most
   likely need to set both the process stack and the OpenMP environment
   variable OMP_STACKSIZE to a large value, such as 128M or greater. See the
   examples at [4]config.html#preenv.

   The spec_qsort.c routine does not strictly obey the ANSI aliasing rules.
   GCC users may need to add -fno-strict-aliasing. See the detailed
   discussion in the documentation for [5]505.mcf_r.

  Sources and Licensing

   527.cam4 is based on an early version of CESM, plus netcdf and several
   BSD-licensed components.
