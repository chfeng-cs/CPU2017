  Benchmark Program General Category

   XSLT processor for transforming XML documents into HTML, text, or other
   XML document types

  Benchmark Description

   This program is a modified version of Xalan-C++, an XSLT processor written
   in a portable subset of C++ .

   Xalan-C++ version 1.10 is a robust implementation of the W3C
   Recommendations for XSL Transformations (XSLT) and the XML Path Language
   (XPath). It works with a compatible release of the Xerces-C++ XML parser:
   Xerces-C++ version 3.0.1. Xalan-C++ (named after a rare musical
   instrument) implements the W3C Recommendation 16 November 1999 XSL
   Transformations (XSLT) Version 1.0 and the XML Path Language (XPath)
   Version 1.0. XSLT is the first part of the XSL stylesheet language for
   XML. It includes the XSL Transformation vocabulary and XPath, a language
   for addressing parts of XML documents.

   You use the XSLT language to compose XSL stylesheets. An XSL stylesheet
   contains instructions for transforming XML documents from one document
   type to another document type (XML, HTML, or other). In structural terms,
   an XSL stylesheet specifies the transformation of one tree of nodes (the
   XML input) into another tree of nodes (the output or transformation
   result).

   Modifications for SPEC(R) benchmarking purposes include:
      1. combining code in a way that makes it a standalone executable
      2. removing compiler incompatibilities and improving standard
   conformance
      3. change the output to display intermediate values
      4. removing large part of unexecuted code that causes differences
   between platforms
      5. finding the test data and contributing fixes to the code to read the
   large 100 MB test data
      6. Moving all the include locations to fit better into the SPEC
   harness.
