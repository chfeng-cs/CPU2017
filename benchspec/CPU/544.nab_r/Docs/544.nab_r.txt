                     SPEC CPU(R)2017 Benchmark Description

  Benchmark Name

   544.nab_r

  Benchmark Author

   Russ Brown <russ.brown[at] yahoo.com>, et al

  Benchmark Program General Category

   Molecular Modeling

  Benchmark Description

   544.nab_r is based on Nucleic Acid Builder (NAB), which is a molecular
   modeling application that performs the types of floating point intensive
   calculations that occur commonly in life science computation. The
   calculations range from relatively unstructured "molecular dynamics" to
   relatively structured linear algebra.

  Input Description

   544.nab_r's input consists molecules with varying numbers of atoms.

   To simulate a molecule, two files are required.

   One is a PDB format text file that specifies the atomic (x,y,z)
   coordinates; most of those were taken from the [1]Brookhaven Protein Data
   Bank. Information at that site details how those files were created.

   The other is a PRM format text file that specifies, among other
   characteristics, the "force field" that indicates how the atoms interact
   with one another. Generating the PRM file involves using the full version
   of NAB to read the PDB file, add protons to the molecule, and output the
   PRM file.

   A small NAB program is required that reads the PDB file, adds H atoms if
   necessary, and outputs new PDB and PRM files. That program, as well as the
   steps necessary to run it, have been encapsulated in the shell script
   makeprm.sh in the benchmark Docs directory. The script requires access to
   a full installation of NAB, as well as working C and Fortran compilers.

  Output Description

   The outputs are summaries of the state of the molecular dynamics
   simulation every 100 iterations and at the end.

  Programming Language

   ANSI C

  Known portability issues

   None

  Sources and Licensing

   The benchmark is drawn from AmberTools 12, under GPL. SPEC(R) added a
   BSD-licensed random number generator, and Henry Spencer's regexp.
