  Benchmark Program General Category

   Games: Sudoku Puzzle Generator

  Benchmark Description

   This program was written for development of non-trivial 9x9 sudoku
   puzzles. It has been used extensively in informal competitions, which run
   for days. Incidentally, it tests many Fortran 95 array handling features
   (including some intrinsic functions) for use with integer arrays.
   Unusually, it relies heavily on recursion (up to eight levels deep) but,
   in contrast to most Fortran programs, uses no floating-point arithmetic.

  Input Description

   The input data file contains in each record a valid sudoku puzzle (one
   that has one and only one solution). It is represented as a string of 81
   digits, 1 to 9 for the clues, and 0 for the empty cells. Each puzzle acts
   as a seed for the production of further valid puzzles with an identical
   pattern of clues. For convenience, the submitted program contains a data
   set of 27 puzzles in the form of an initialization expression. A second
   set can be extracted from the first by not transposing the puzzle on
   input.

  Output Description

   The file s.txt contains each new puzzle as an 81-digit string followed by
   a sequence number and 1 or 2 codes.

  Programming Language

   Fortran 95

  Known portability issues

   None
