                     SPEC CPU(R)2017 Benchmark Description

  Benchmark Name

   511.povray_r

  Benchmark Author

  Benchmark Program General Category

   Computer Visualization / Raytracing

  Benchmark Description

   POV-Ray is a free and open source ray-tracing application. The CPU 2017
   version is based on POV-Ray version 3.7.

  Input Description

   The benchmark's input consists of:

     * An ASCII text POV-Ray parameters (.ini) file. The included .ini file
       specifies the name of the input geometry file, the output log file,
       and the output image file name.
     * A POV-Ray scene description language (.pov) geometry file. The input
       geometry file represents a chess board scene constructed in the
       POV-Ray scene description language.

  Output Description

   The benchmark renders a 2560 x 2048 pixel image of a chess board, with the
   pieces placed on the board in the starting position. The rendered scene
   image is saved as a Targa (.tga) file.

   This output image is compared with the reference output image using the
   SPEC(R) utility [1]imagevalidate, which calculates a the structural
   similarity (SSIM) index between corresponding 8x8 groups of pixels in each
   image. The SSIM index has a range of -1 (maximal difference) to 1
   (identical). The benchmark requires that all computed SSIM indices be
   greater than 0.996 in order for the run to be considered successful.

   A log of the execution is also generated, but its contents are not used to
   validate correction operation of the benchmark.

  Programming Language

   ISO C++

  Threading Model

   None

  Known portability issues

     * Users of the Intel^(R) Compiler on Windows may get the mathimf.h and
       direct.h header files included by defining the SPEC_WINDOWS_ICL
       preprocessor macro.
     * The spec_qsort.c routine does not strictly obey the ANSI aliasing
       rules. GCC users may need to add -fno-strict-aliasing. See the
       detailed discussion in the documentation for [2]505.mcf_r.
