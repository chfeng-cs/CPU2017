SPEC CPU&reg;2017 Benchmark Description</h1>
</div>
 
<h3>Benchmark Name</h3>
<p>644.nab_s</p>

<h3>Benchmark Author</h3>
<p>Russ Brown &lt;russ.brown&#x5b;at&#x5d; yahoo.com&gt;, et al</p>

<h3>Benchmark Program General Category</h3>
<p>Molecular Modeling</p>
 
<h3>Benchmark Description</h3>
<p>644.nab_s is based on Nucleic Acid Builder (NAB), which is a molecular
modeling application that performs the types of floating point intensive
calculations that occur commonly in life science computation.  The calculations
range from relatively unstructured "molecular dynamics" to relatively
structured linear algebra.</p>


<h3>Input Description</h3>
<p>644.nab_s's input consists molecules with varying numbers of atoms.</p>

<p>To simulate a molecule, two files are required.</p>

<p>One is a PDB format text file that specifies the atomic (x,y,z)
coordinates; most of those were taken from the
<a href="http://www.rcsb.org">Brookhaven Protein Data Bank</a>.  Information
at that site details how those files were created.</p>

<p>The other is a PRM format text file that specifies, among other
characteristics, the "force field" that indicates how the atoms interact with
one another.  Generating the PRM file involves using the full version of
NAB to read the PDB file, add protons to the molecule, and output the PRM
file.</p>

<p>A small NAB program is required that reads the PDB file, adds H atoms
if necessary, and outputs new PDB and PRM files.  That program, as well
as the steps necessary to run it, have been encapsulated in the shell
script <tt>makeprm.sh</tt> in the benchmark Docs directory.  The script
requires access to a full installation of NAB, as well as working C and
Fortran compilers.</p>


<h3>Output Description</h3>
<p>The outputs are summaries of the state of the molecular dynamics simulation
every 100 iterations and at the end.</p>


<h3>Programming Language</h3>
<p>ANSI C</p>


<h3>Known portability issues</h3>
<p>None</p>

<h3 id="license">Sources and Licensing</h3>

<p>The benchmark is drawn from AmberTools 12, under GPL.  SPEC&reg; added a BSD-licensed random number generator, and Henry
Spencer's regexp.  </p>
